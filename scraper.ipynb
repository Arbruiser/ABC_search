       " 'EGFR+ lung cancer is a type of lung cancer, not linked to smoking, that is caused by one of a number of nonhereditary gene mutations.',\n",
       " 'One mutation, exon 20, had no effective treatments beyond chemotherapy until a tyrosine kinase inhibitor called Mobocertinib (marketed as Exkivity) was licensed in 2021.',\n",
       " 'However, the manufacturers withdrew it from use in the United States late last year, and health authorities in the United Kingdom plan to follow suit next month.',\n",
       " 'EGFR+ campaigners are concerned that people in the United Kingdom with this mutation will now have no treatment options to extend life after chemotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Even though, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 80–90% of lung cancer cases are linked to smoking, a significant number of lung cancers are not smoking-related.',\n",
       " 'Most of these are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), caused by mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor, termed EGFR+ lung cancers.',\n",
       " 'These cancers often present in younger people and have atypical symptoms, such as shoulder pain, or other musculoskeletal symptoms, rather than the coughing, breathlessness and recurrent chest infections that are usually seen in smoking-related lung cancers.',\n",
       " 'Several different nonhereditary mutations can lead to EGFR+ lung cancer. The most common are EGFR 19 deletion — where part of the gene is missing — and EGFR L858R point mutation, in which one nucleotide (small unit of DNA) is altered.',\n",
       " 'Why mobocertinib is important for people with lung cancer',\n",
       " 'The exon 20 insertion mutation is the third most common cause of EGFR+ lung cancer, being responsible for up to 10% of cases. People with this mutation generally have a poorer prognosis than people with different mutations.',\n",
       " 'Apart from platinum-based chemotherapy, there were no effective treatments for exon 20 available in the United Kingdom, as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used to treat other EGFR+ mutations do not work against exon 20.',\n",
       " 'However, in 2021, a new TKI, mobocertinib (Exkivity), received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The oral therapy was approved for use in the U.K. in November 2022.',\n",
       " 'Prof. Siow Ming Lee, professor of medical oncology at University College London, and consultant medical oncologist at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) told Medical News Today:',\n",
       " '“NSCLC patients with the uncommon EGFR+ exon 20 insertion mutations have an unmet need. […] Mobocertinib is a first-in-class, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed to selectively target the uncommon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon20 insertion mutations.”',\n",
       " 'Global withdrawal of mobocertinib: What it means',\n",
       " 'Dr. Gini Harrison, psychologist and research trustee at EGFR+ UK, and EGFR+ survivor, also emphasized how withdrawing mobocertinib from use would severely impact people who rely on it the most.',\n",
       " 'She explained:',\n",
       " '“Mobocertinib is currently the only drug in the U.K. that is licensed for use with this patient group in an NHS [National Health Service] setting. Removing this drug from the market will mean that these patients have no treatment options beyond chemotherapy, which will certainly reduce lifespans and increase mortality rates.”',\n",
       " 'In early clinical trials, mobocertinib was well tolerated by patients, stopped their cancer from worsening, and increased their survival time, leading to optimism about its potential for people with the exon 20 mutation.',\n",
       " 'However, in October 2023, the manufacturer, Takeda, voluntarily withdrew Mobocertinib from use in the United States.',\n",
       " 'In phase 3 clinical trials, the drug failed to show a significant effect on progression-free survival (PFS). During the trial, 17% of participants stopped the treatment, half of the patients had to take a break in treatment, and 25% needed the dose reduced because of side effects, although there were no significant safety concerns.',\n",
       " 'Takeda said in a press release that it was withdrawing the drug because “the Phase 3 EXCLAIM-2 confirmatory trial, […] did not meet its primary endpoint and thus did not fulfil the confirmatory data requirements of the Accelerated Approval granted by the U.S. FDA nor the conditional marketing approvals granted in other countries.”',\n",
       " 'However, Prof. Lee explained that the trial had its own shortcomings.',\n",
       " '“It is unfortunate that when Takeda designed the first-line trial, the investigator did not include a separate trial arm combining Mobocertinib with chemotherapy,“ he told us.',\n",
       " '“Instead, they tested a mobocertinib monotherapy arm against standard chemotherapy, despite knowing that the best ORR [tumor objective response rate] achieved as a second line was approximately 30% in pre-treated NSCLC patients,” Prof. Lee noted.',\n",
       " 'How will lung cancer patients in the UK be affected?',\n",
       " 'And if health authorities do withdraw this drug from use in the U.K.? Prof. Lee warned:',\n",
       " '“Patients relapsing after first-line platinum chemotherapy will no longer be able to access the drug after the official withdrawal of the conditional marketing authorization for mobocertinib, which will occur in March 2024.”',\n",
       " 'Dr. Harrison also expressed her frustration to MNT, saying that “[t]he withdrawal of Mobocertinib is purely based on the fact that the drug failed to meet its clinical endpoint in a recent clinical trial.“',\n",
       " '”It is not being withdrawn due to safety concerns, and indeed, no new safety concerns have arisen since the drug received its initial licence,” she emphasized.',\n",
       " '“Instead,” Dr. Harrison explained, “the drug is being withdrawn because it was licensed on the proviso that a positive result was achieved in an RCT [randomised control trial], showing it to be more efficacious than chemotherapy in a first line setting.”',\n",
       " '”The recent RCT (EXCLAIM-2) [trial] showed this was not achieved; however, [the drug] was shown to be as effective as chemotherapy in this setting. Given the effectiveness is on par with a licensed, effective treatment, withdrawing the drug entirely seems both unnecessary and harmful to patients,” she added.',\n",
       " 'Although mobocertinib will not be available for new patients going forward, Prof. Lee gave some reassurance to those already taking the medication.',\n",
       " '“Patients initiated on treatment with mobocertinib before its withdrawal will still be able to access the drug through a compassionate use programme free of charge as long as they are deriving clinical benefit from the medication,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Call for alternative treatment to be made available in UK',\n",
       " 'There are alternatives to Mobocertinib in the U.S., but it is the only treatment funded by the National Health Service (NHS) for exon 20 patients in the U.K.',\n",
       " 'One other drug licensed for use in the U.K. that has shown potential for exon 20 — aminvantamab — is available only privately, so cannot be accessed by those without private insurance or other means of funding, as Dr. Harrison explained.',\n",
       " '“Amivantamab is an efficacious drug that is used in standard practice for exon 20 patients in Europe and the USA. It is actually approved for private use by the MHRA in the U.K., but is not currently licensed by NICE. While NICE recognises Amivantamab is likely to be efficacious for exon 20, they deem it too expensive to offer it on the NHS.”',\n",
       " '– Dr. Gini Harrison',\n",
       " 'She called for the drug to be made available to NHS patients: “[r]ecent randomised controlled trials have shown that amivantamab is likely to be a very efficacious alternative to mobocertinib.”',\n",
       " '“Given that this drug is already available privately in the U.K., we suggest that there should be a way to expedite NICE approval processes in situations where the withdrawal of a drug from the market leaves a treatment gap and an unmet need for patients,” she added.',\n",

       " '“The odds ratios that were reported in this study, which can be thought of as the increased odds of an outcome (e.g., developing IBD) with a given exposure (e.g., migraine headaches), were consistently between one to two, which is not far from definitive and can be easily misinterpreted or misrepresented,” he explained.',\n",
       " '“The results are, at best, suggestive of an association between migraines and IBD, which we were already aware of based on previous research and deserve to be further evaluated. However, the minimal increase in the odds of developing IBD reported in this study is not sufficient to recommend increased monitoring of patients with migraines for the development of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.”',\n",

       " '“Migraines can be very debilitating and you may want to identify those people with migraines,” he continued. “We don’t normally question patients with inflammatory bowel disease whether or not they have migraine headaches, so it probably rates as something that should be done more frequently.”',\n",

       " 'Tissue harvested after the age of 40 years did not delay menopause onset as there were too few viable follicles left in the tissue of the typical donor.',\n",
       " '“The younger the person, the larger number of eggs she has, as well as the higher the quality of those eggs,” Prof. Oktay said. The amount of tissue harvested was key — too little and menopause would not be delayed, but if too much was taken, this might bring on an early menopause. However, the model accounted for this: “This model gives us the optimum amount of tissue to harvest for a person of a given age,” he added.',\n",
       " 'To illustrate their model, the researchers give the example of a 25-year-old who had 25% of her ovarian cortex tissue harvested, and then transplanted in one procedure. If 40% of the follicles survived, this might delay menopause by almost 12 years; if 80% survived, the delay would be around 15.5 years. Authors noted that currently, ovarian transplant procedures are associated with a 60% loss of follices and that 80% survival could only be achieved if technology and techniques progressed in coming years.',\n",
       " 'However, if they divided up the tissue and transplanted it in several procedures, menopause delay was increased. At 40% follicle survival, three transplants extended the delay to 23 years, and six transplants to 31 years. If 80% of follicles survived, the model predicted that menopause might be delayed by as much as 47 years, which, for most women, would mean that they would never experience menopause.',\n",

Many women struggle with issues during their reproductive years — PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, painful periods, heavy periods, undesired fertility, premenstrual dysphoric disorder — would they want to prolong their cycles? I think not. Would they want to delay or avoid the symptoms of menopause — very likely. And we can do that with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) without exacerbating those other symptoms.”— Dr. Robin Noble',\n",
       " 'Menopause is considered a normal part of human aging, not an illness or medical condition, so should it be delayed? Many women welcome the end of their monthly periods, particularly those with menstrual disorders, and many cope with the symptoms of menopause without intervention. For many that do require support, hormone therapy is often effective.',\n",
       " 'However, for others, perimenopause and menopause may mean several years of troubling symptoms that can affect their quality of life. As we live longer, many women will spend around one-third of their lives postmenopausal, so they may wish to shorten that time.',\n",
       " 'Apart from delaying symptoms, studies have shown that there may be other benefits to later menopause. Those who experience a later menopause have lower all-cause mortality, reduced risk of osteoporosis, and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. However, they do have an increased risk of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.',\n",
       " '“Do we need cryopreserved ovaries to accomplish these goals?” Dr. Noble questioned.',\n",
       " '“With MHT, we can give back some of these hormones at various doses, with the option of tailoring to the symptoms and goals of the person, understanding the risks and benefits of various treatment options. Moreover, MHT avoids the cyclic symptoms (often bothersome bleeding, mood changes, bloating, breast tenderness, cyclic migraines) that would be present in the case of preserved ovaries,” she explained.',\n",
       " 'But the option of surgery to remove and then replace cryopreserved ovarian tissue should not be taken lightly, as it does involve repeated abdominal or keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery. So, a woman would need to think carefully about whether, for her, the benefits of delaying menopause outweigh the risks.',\n",

       " 'To address the pervasive condition, scientists are investigating how NIHL occurs on the cellular level in the body. In research published this week in the journal PNAS, scientists appear to be another step closer to understanding and potentially preventing NIHL.',\n",
       " 'What the study on hearing loss showed',\n",
       " 'In the study, scientists found that loud noises affected parts of the ear on a molecular level, disrupting hearing function specifically having to do with the mineral zinc in the cochlea, a spiral-shaped cavity in the inner ear that converts sound waves into electrical impulses that the brain interprets as sound frequencies.',\n",
       " 'Zinc plays an important role in the body, including supporting the immune system and chemical signaling in the brain.',\n",
       " 'Researchers reported that when mice were exposed to loud noises the rodents’ labile zinc levels spiked. Labile zinc is zinc that is “free” and has not bound to a protein. This dysregulation of zinc in turn led to damage and degeneration at the cellular level, manifesting as hearing loss.',\n",

We also are the first to document the dysregulation of zinc signaling in the inner ear after loud noise exposure. Most importantly, we are the first to show that noise-induced hearing loss can be mitigated by administering compounds that chelate, or trap, excess free zinc,” Thanos Tzounopoulos, PhD, the director of the Pittsburgh Hearing Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh and senior author of the study, told Medical News Today.',\n",

       " 'Zinc is found throughout the body, but it is highly concentrated in the inner ear.',\n",
       " 'Dysregulation of zinc signaling has been investigated in other traumatic experiences, including stroke and optic nerve damage, where it’s been associated with tissue damage. It hasn’t been looked at as a mechanism for hearing loss.',\n",
       " 'A 2023 study found that in stroke patients, following a cerebral ischemia, “intracellular zinc accumulation has been shown to be associated with neuronal death.”',\n",
       " 'So, just as zinc is associated with cellular damage in other parts of the body, it is now believed to play a role in hearing loss.',\n",
       " '“Under normal conditions, at least in the brain, but perhaps also in the inner ear, ‘free’ zinc functions by fine-tuning synaptic communications between nerve cells and helps sensory processing. But, as previous literature showed, dysregulation in free zinc signaling can cause cell degeneration and death,” said Tzounopoulos.',\n",
       " 'He and his team hope that this finding and the subsequent use of zinc chelators to prevent hearing loss could one day serve as an additional therapy for hearing loss. In the study, the zinc chelator was applied directly to the inner ear or into the belly of the mouse prior to a loud noise exposure.',\n",
       " '“The fact that both options were effective at protecting mice from hearing loss suggests that, in the future, we could develop a pill that a person could take before a known loud sound exposure to protect oneself from hearing loss,” said Tzounopoulos.',\n",
       " 'Preventing hearing loss',\n",
       " 'Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by a single incident of loud noise, such as an explosion, or progressively through exposure to loud noises, like working with machinery.',\n",
       " 'It can even be caused by things you experience in daily life, such as traffic or listening to loud music.',\n",

       " 'Hearing aids are the “gold standard” for treatment of NIHL, but there are also surgical and even some medicinal options. However, when it comes to hearing loss, the best thing to do is to prevent it in the first place.',\n",
       " '“People do not realize how damaging loud noises can be.

Moreover, their risk of death halved again for those who engaged in at least 60 minutes of exercise per week.',\n",
       " 'Is any physical activity good?',\n",
       " 'In our podcast, Dr. del Pozo Cruz emphasized that almost any amount of any form of exercise is better than none, a point reinforced by a new study arguing that any activity at all is better for heart health than a sedentary lifestyle.',\n",
       " 'However, he also cautioned that physical activity related to chores or to one’s job, as opposed to exercise in a leisure context, may sometimes do more harm than good.',\n",
       " 'Once again, his idea is supported by recently published research, which found a link between physically demanding occupations and a higher risk of cognitive impairment.',\n",
       " 'Some of the most common occupations linked to intensive physical activity cited in this research were in nursing and care, retail, and farming, where individuals are on their feet a lot, and often having to deal with stressful situations.',\n",
       " 'So while all forms of exercise can be good for health, strenuous or intensive physical activity in a work environment could end up compounding the risk of various health conditions.',\n",
       " 'And even exercise for leisure can affect aspects of physical health — such as joint integrity — particularly later in life.

       " 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of people, often severely impacting their day-to-day lives. What role does the gut microbiome play in IBD, and can we harness dietary interventions to manage symptoms? Medical News Today explores this question In Conversation with a researcher and an expert through lived experience.',\n",
       " 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella-term that encompasses ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, two chronic gastrointestinal conditions characterized by inflammation of the gut.',\n",
       " 'Some of the symptoms of IBD include nausea and vomiting, blood in stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and irregularities in the menstrual cycle — all of these are invisible issues that can severely impact a person’s quality of life on a daily basis.',\n",
       " 'IBD affects many people all over the world. In the United States, for example, around 1% of all adults have diagnosed IBD — and while that may seem like a small percentage overall, it actually amounts to approximately 2 million people.',\n",
       " 'In the United Kingdom, the most recent estimates suggest that IBD affects around 0.8% of the population, or around 131,000 people.',\n",
       " 'And that figure may be a serious underestimate of the real prevalence of IBD, as both Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis have symptoms that can also be attributed to other chronic conditions, which often makes them difficult to diagnose.',\n",
       " 'Research from the U.K. published in the Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis in 2020 suggested that an individual could see their doctor in relation to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms for 5 years before they receive the correct diagnosis of IBD.',\n",
       " 'A different gut microbiome',\n",
       " 'Yet recent research shows that in people with IBD, the gut microbiome — the community of bacteria and other microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract — has certain particularities that set it apart from the microbiomes of healthy individuals, and which may offer clues to better treatments.',\n",
       " 'In this episode of our In Conversation podcast, we speak to Dr. Marcel de Zoete, an associate professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology at UMC Utrecht, The Netherlands.',\n",
       " 'In January 2023, Dr. de Zoete and his colleagues published a paper in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, showing that people with IBD had two previously unidentified bacterial species in their intestinal tracts — a new species of Allobaculum mucilyticum, and a new species of Allobaculum fili. This finding may offer important clues about the underlying mechanisms in IBD, as well as potential new treatments.',\n",
       " 'Can diet help manage symptoms?',\n",
       " 'Joining us in conversation was also Zosia Krajewska, who lives with ulcerative colitis, and received her diagnosis at the age of 14.',\n",
       " 'Zosia told us about how changing her diet and lifestyle — alongside medical treatments — has helped her manage her ulcerative colitis and feel healthier, overall.',\n",
       " 'Past research has suggested that, in some people, dietary fiber and high-sugar diets can worsen the symptoms of IBD, while favoring ultra-processed foods can increase the risk of Crohn’s disease.',\n",
       " 'Conversely, a recent study showed that following a healthy diet and having a healthy lifestyle may help reduce a person’s risk of IBD.',\n",
       " 'Future research avenues for treatments',\n",
       " 'Beyond lifestyle interventions, however, it is also important for researchers to find better ways of fighting the underlying mechanisms of IBD.',\n",
       " 'One promising avenue is research looking at gut immune cells, which play an important role in inflammation and other processes in the gut. Harnessing immune cell activity in the gut may, in the future, help treat different forms of IBD.',\n",
       " 'Another potential treatment line that has been receiving attention from researchers, but which is currently only rarely used in clinical settings, is fecal microbiota transplantation. This presupposes the transfer of “good bacteria” into the guts of people with gastrointestinal disorders.',\n",

       " 'It’s not often that something we read, listen to, or see has a real lasting impact on our behavior. In fact, sparking such a fundamental change in habits—owing to the nature of the way the human brain operates—is a lot more complex than thought.',\n",

For Dr. Guite, the episode and the frank discussions we had helped her get over that initial fear of donating blood and prompted her to become a donor again after a 20–30-year break.',\n",
       " 'She said the blood donor and the recipient talking about the “gift of life” was especially inspirational, and what Dr. Baia Lasky, medical director of the American Red Cross, said next really chimed in with her life values:',\n",

If you always buy one kind of oil to cook with buy six kinds of oil. I mean, flax oil is a good one for omega-3s— [especially] if you don’t like oily fish, which not everybody would like,” she recalled Rachel Kelly, a U.K.-based mental health campaigner who has been outspoken about how diet helped treat her own depression, saying on that episode.',\n",

       " 'We also talked about “happy foods” such as green leafy vegetables, oily fish, and dark chocolate. Maria shared that she had incorporated more fish into her diet and her favorite hojicha, Japanese green tea. (Also, the episode contains an impromptu recipe for a Mediterranean-inspired mung bean salad.)',\n",
       " 'Changing how we feel',\n",
       " 'For me, there were many contenders, but perhaps the first one that came to mind was September 2022’s podcast on chronic pain. In that episode, we delved into the science behind how pain becomes chronic and addressed what it means when we say “pain is the brain.” We also shared with our listeners our own experiences— led by Joel Nelson, a longtime psoriatic disease and arthritis patient and advocate, who shared his personal journey with pain.',\n",
       " 'One of the quotes that stood out to me in that episode was by Dr. Tony L. Yaksh, professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology at the University of California, San Diego:',\n",
       " '“[W]e started out this conversation by saying pain is in the brain. So when I say pain is in the brain, I am not saying it’s any less real, in any way, shape, or form. It’s a real thing. [W]e now teach medical students that just because you don’t see the primary diagnosis as being a swollen joint doesn’t mean the patient doesn’t have something. [T]he intent is to actually validate and bring into reality, the kinds of issues that occur when you discover that stress and so forth has changed this pain condition. [M]indfulness in a way can help the individual.”',\n",
       " 'Not long after this podcast, I enrolled in a genetics-based nutrition and mindfulness program that helped me shift my views about pain and chronic inflammation, leading me to tweak my ways of managing pain. The biggest takeaway for me from that episode was that the key to managing and treating pain was lowering stress levels and inflammation and building up mental resilience. In this episode, I shared some of the steps I took to achieve that— which included a different approach to using painkillers.',\n",
