      "Previous research shows that migraine can potentially increase a person’s risk for several health issues, including gastrointestinal conditions.\n",
      "New research from Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea says there may also be a link between migraine and an increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n",
      "More than 1 billion people globally have at least one migraine attack each year.\n",
      "Previous studies show that migraine can potentially increase a person’s risk for other conditions, including stroke, heart disease, epilepsy, sleeping issues, and anxiety and depression.\n",
      "Migraine has also been linked to some gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n",
      "Now, researchers from Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea say there may also be a link between migraine and an increased risk for irritable bowel disease (IBD), which is an umbrella term that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.\n",
      "The study was recently published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n",
      "Migraine and IBD: An unsurprising connection\n",
      "According to Dr. Brooks D. Cash, professor and chief of the division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at UTHealth Houston in Texas, who was not involved in this study, the field of gastroenterology has recognized for many years that migraine has been associated with many chronic gastrointestinal syndromes and diseases.\n",
      "“The data in this report supports previous reports of an association between migraine headaches and IBD,” Dr. Cash told Medical News Today.\n",
      "Dr. Rudolph Bedford, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was also not involved in this study, told MNT that the research results were not surprising.\n",
      "“[With] inflammatory bowel disease we do see some extra-intestinal manifestations including things involving the eye or ocular findings, which may be neurogenic in nature, so it wasn’t surprising,” Dr. Bedford added.\n",
      "This is not the first study to look at a connection between migraine and IBD.\n",
      "A study published in March 2021 of people in the United States found a higher prevalence of migraine or severe headaches among adults with IBD than in those without.\n",
      "Research published in March 2023 reported an increased prevalence of IBD in people with migraine with and without aura.\n",
      "Could migraine increase risk of inflammatory bowel disease?\n",
      "For the current study, researchers analyzed data from more than 10 million people through the nationwide healthcare system for South Korean citizens. About 3% of the study population had IBD.\n",
      "Through the data, scientists found the incidence of IBD was significantly higher in people who had migraine compared to those who did not.\n",
      "Scientists also reviewed the data through subgroups of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis incidences. People with migraine in both subgroups had a higher risk of developing either condition when compared to people without migraine.\n",
      "After a migraine diagnosis, researchers found people were at a higher risk of developing Crohn’s disease, with a significant rise after a 5-year follow-up.\n",
      "Additionally, within the subgroups, scientists reported that the impact of migraine on the risk of developing ulcerative colitis was more prominent in men than women.\n",
      "Study results not definitive\n",
      "Based on these findings, the research team suggests that people with migraine be monitored carefully for the development of IBD.\n",
      "However, Dr. Cash stated that the data presented do not convincingly support that approach or recommendation.\n",
      "“The odds ratios that were reported in this study, which can be thought of as the increased odds of an outcome (e.g., developing IBD) with a given exposure (e.g., migraine headaches), were consistently between one to two, which is not far from definitive and can be easily misinterpreted or misrepresented,” he explained.\n",
      "“The results are, at best, suggestive of an association between migraines and IBD, which we were already aware of based on previous research and deserve to be further evaluated. However, the minimal increase in the odds of developing IBD reported in this study is not sufficient to recommend increased monitoring of patients with migraines for the development of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.”\n",
      "– Dr. Brooks D. Cash\n",
      "Importance of identifying potential IBD triggers\n",
      "Dr. Bedford said it is important to identify potential health issues that may trigger IBD, as a doctor may be able to mitigate the symptoms of IBD if they know what may be associated with it.\n",
      "“Migraines can be very debilitating and you may want to identify those people with migraines,” he continued. “We don’t normally question patients with inflammatory bowel disease whether or not they have migraine headaches, so it probably rates as something that should be done more frequently.”\n",
      "“These results add to an already relatively robust body of research suggesting that chronic pain syndromes are statistically more common in patients with chronic GI syndromes or diseases,” Dr. Cash said.\n",
      "“We do not have enough information or proof yet to establish a causal relationship either way. But this data can be used to explain some therapeutic approaches that may benefit both GI and neurologic symptoms in patients with migraines,” he added.\n",
      "Research next steps\n",
      "Regarding the next steps for this research, Dr. Cash said that mechanistic data evaluating the possible reasons for these consistent observations of association is needed.\n",
      "“Right now, all we have are hypotheses,” he continued. “Are there changes in the gut-brain communication pathways or sensory perceptions in the enteric and central nervous systems? Is the gut microbiome involved? Are there psychological and stress-mediated factors at play?”\n",
      "“Once clinical relationships such as these have been identified, we need to move toward trying to explain why those relationships may exist,” Dr. Cash added. “That, in turn, may lead us to develop more targeted and effective therapies that can address multiple symptoms/syndromes.”\n",
      "Dr. Bedford suggested researchers look for an association between IBD flares and migraine occurring at the same time. As migraine is associated with serotonin release, he encouraged researchers to examine how the serotonin transporters within the GI tract, small bowel, and colon might play a role.\n",
      "“I think just questioning our patients in terms of quality of life issues — is there any way that we can mitigate their migraine headaches, potentially preventing their inflammatory bowel disease flare, or vice versa, is certainly something to look into,” Dr. Bedford said.\n",
      "At least 65 million people globally have long COVID.\n",
      "The most common symptoms of long COVID include post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, brain fog, sleep problems, and fatigue, which can have a severe impact on a person’s life.\n",
      "Researchers are still unsure why some people develop long COVID and its symptoms while others do not.\n",
      "Researchers from the Amsterdam University Medical Center have discovered that the fatigue experienced by those with long COVID has a physical cause.\n",
      "At least 65 million people around the world have long COVID, a condition where they continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms for months after their symptoms originally start.\n",
      "The most common symptoms of long COVID are fatigue, dizziness, mobility issues, sleep problems, cognitive impairment, and brain fog or inability to concentrate.\n",
      "These types of lingering symptoms can have a profound impact on a person’s life. A study published in June 2023 found more than half of people with long COVID reported their work, home, social, and private lives were severely impacted by the symptoms, with fatigue being the main problem.\n",
      "Scientists are still unsure as to why some people develop long COVID and its symptoms while others do not.\n",
      "Now researchers from the Amsterdam University Medical Center are helping to provide some answers with their new study — recently published in the journal Nature Communications — that found the fatigue experienced by those with long COVID has a physical cause.\n",
      "Impact of long COVID fatigue on life quality\n",
      "Prof. Michèle van Vugt, professor of internal medicine at the Amsterdam University Medical Center and co-lead author of this study, told Medical News Today she and her colleagues decided to look for a physical cause of the tiredness experienced by people with long COVID because of the impact it has on their lives.\n",
      "“Those long COVID patients used to be like you and me totally integrated [into] society with a job, social life, and private life,” Prof. van Vugt explained. “After their COVID infection, for some of them, nothing was left because of their extreme fatigue. And this happened not only in one patient but many more — too many for only [a] psychological cause.”\n",
      "Past studies report that fatigue is the most common symptom reported by people who have long COVID.\n",
      "A study published in December 2023 found that people with long COVID self-report persistently continuously low levels of health-related quality of life, as well as a high level of disability and declined levels of physical and mental health.\n",
      "And research published in April 2023 reported that fatigue caused by long COVID may cause structural changes to the brain.\n",
      "Lowered mitochondrial function\n",
      "For this study, Prof. van Vugt and her team recruited 25 people with long COVID and 21 healthy control participants. They were all asked to take a cycling test for approximately 15 minutes, that was designed to push them to maximum exertion.\n",
      "According to researchers, the cycling test caused a worsening of symptoms in the participants with long COVID, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM), resulting in worsening of fatigue for up to 7 days after.\n",
      "Scientists examined blood and muscle tissue samples from all participants both one week before the cycling test and one day after.\n",
      "They found various abnormalities in the muscle tissue of the participants with long COVID, including lowered functioning of the mitochondria of the muscle. Known as the “powerhouse of the cell,” mitochondria are responsible for making the energy needed to power the body’s cells.\n",
      "“So, the cause of the fatigue is really biological,” Prof. van Vugt explained. “The brain needs energy to think. Muscles need energy to move. This discovery means we can now start to research an appropriate treatment for those with long COVID.”\n",
      "Tailored exercises: Good or bad for long COVID?\n",
      "Prof. van Vugt said the the research team was surprised by their study’s findings related to muscle tissue abnormalities.\n",
      "“However, we [could then] understand much better the symptoms of fatigue in the patients,” she added.\n",
      "When asked about the next steps planned for this research, Prof. van Vugt said they plan to examine whether the same muscle alterations can be found in other post-infectious patients to hopefully uncover the cause of these changes in the muscle, leading to proof of concept studies for treatment.\n",
      "“Doctors should acknowledge the complaints of long COVID patients and we should advise very carefully about performing tailored exercises. And as researchers, we should support our medical colleagues with our gained knowledge to support patients with their symptoms and in the meantime [try] to discover a biomarker as a diagnostic tool plus finally a treatment.”\n",
      "– Prof. Michèle van Vugt\n",
      "A condition that is challenging to treat\n",
      "MNT also spoke with Dr. David Cutler, a board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. Dr. Cutler was not involved in the research.\n",
      "Dr. Cutler commented that the topic of long COVID sparks controversy and strong emotions because it remains poorly defined, difficult to diagnose, and challenging to treat.\n",
      "“Despite scientific consensus about its existence, the lack of a definitive diagnostic test and its variable presentation continues to make many skeptical of its existence,” he explained. “As a clinician, [I find that] this [research] is helpful in reassuring long COVID sufferers that what they are experiencing is physically real, and not merely psychological.”\n",
      "“Lacking a specific cure for this condition, the most important treatment physicians can provide is reassurance,” Dr. Cutler continued.\n",
      "“Patients must be allowed [an] opportunity to present their symptoms to a receptive physician, they must be thoroughly evaluated to exclude other conditions, the diagnosis of long COVID should then be specifically endorsed, patients need to be informed of the generally favorable long-term prognosis, and adequate follow-up provided. This is the basis for optimal reassurance.”\n",
      "– Dr. David Cutler\n",
      "Regarding fatigue, Dr. Cutler said a program of graded exercise to avoid worsening symptoms seems to be best.\n",
      "“However, at this point, the findings of this one study of just 25 patients does not significantly enhance our ability to treat these patients’ complaints of fatigue,” he added. “But it does help to explain their symptoms which aids in reassurance and lessens anxiety. Future research could be aimed at attempts to lessen fatigue with various regimens of exercise, nutritional support, and emotional therapy to ease the suffering of those with long COVID.”\n",
      "Statins are a drug that reduces cholesterol in the bloodstream, and while they were initially designed to prevent heart disease and cardiac events, they are increasingly being used to prevent other conditions linked to cholesterol.\n",
      "Some researchers believe that the most common forms of dementia may be caused in part by changes to cholesterol metabolism and blood flow to the brain.\n",
      "A longitudinal cohort study of older adults with dementia in Sweden has shown that statin use is linked to improved cognition over a period of three years, with some statins performing better than others.\n",
      "Every year there are 10 million new dementia cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but few treatment or prevention options available.\n",
      "The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by a build-up of betamyloid plaques and tau peptide tangles in the brain.\n",
      "The second most common cause of dementia is vascular dementia, which is caused when blood vessels in the brain get blocked, reducing blood flow to the region.\n",
      "It can occur after a stroke, but individuals do not have to have a stroke to have vascular dementia. It is also possible that Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia can co-occur.\n",
      "What is cholesterol’s role in dementia?\n",
      "High cholesterol is linked to both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, particularly in men. Researchers hypothesize that cholesterol dysregulation prevents the normal breakdown of cholesterol in the body, leading to levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol rising to levels that can cause various problems.\n",
      "This could lead to atherosclerosis, which can increase the risk of vascular dementia, and it could also dysregulate the take up of the tau protein, which could accelerate its accumulation in the brain, a characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
      "That is also why statins could help decrease dementia risk in some cases. Statins are a drug that has been used for decades to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, primarily with the aim of reducing heart disease and resulting cardiac events.\n",
      "Dr. Clifford Segil, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told Medical News Today:\n",
      "“In patients with memory loss one of the most common types of dementia is vascular dementia or multi-infarct dementia and any medication which lowers cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors like a statin, would lower patient’s chances of getting this type of dementia.”\n",
      "Do statins help fight dementia symptoms?\n",
      "Researchers from Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, have recently looked at the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders (SveDem) to determine if statin use had an impact on cognition in older adults.\n",
      "The results of their study are reported in a paper published in the journal Alzheimer’s Research and Therapy.\n",
      "They investigated the records of 15,586 individuals with different forms of dementia, with an average age of 79.5 years at diagnosis, 10,869 of whom took statins. Data were collected from 2007, and all patients were followed until death, emigration or end of follow-up.\n",
      "Dr. Sara Garcia-Ptacek, assistant professor and neurologist at the Cognitive Clinic, Karolinska University Hospital, lead researcher and lead author of the study, told MNT that “[t]he potential neuroprotective effects of statins have been discussed for a long time.“\n",
      "“There were some clinical studies which were negative and some observational studies showing an association with dementia prevention and/or progression. SveDem is the world’s largest clinical dementia cohort and the indication and types of patients receiving statins have changed over time,“ she added. “We wanted to check what the association was between statin use and cognition in patients with Alzheimer’s in the SveDem cohort.”\n",
      "Researchers for the SveDem used a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) to evaluate cognition and this data was recorded. Researchers for this paper analysed the scores recorded at baseline and follow-ups. Data from the cohort was disaggregated into the different types of statin taken by participants. Findings were adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities and medications other than statins.\n",
      "The researchers found that overall, statin users who took one defined daily dose of statins on average had a 0.63 more MMSE points after 3 years of follow-up compared to those who did not use statins.\n",
      "Simvastatin, which was the most prescribed statin in Sweden at the time, was associated with 1.01 more MMSE points after 3 years compared to atorvastatin users. Patients under 79.5 years when diagnosed who took simvastatin had 0.80 more MMSE points compared to younger atorvastatin users after 3 years. Simvastatin users had 1.03 more MMSE points compared to rosuvastatin users after 3 years.\n",
      "Statins are safe to take in dementia\n",
      "The study confirmed that, despite previous concerns that statins could cause confusion, that they are in fact safe in this group of older patients with dementia, and do not contribute to cognitive decline, said Dr. Segil.\n",
      "Dr Garcia-Ptacek said: “Our current hypothesis is that these two things may be simultaneously true: acute changes when starting statins — for example, in brain cholesterol — could potentially cause confusion in sensitive individuals while the long-term effects could be protective. However, this is just an hypothesis which will need to be confirmed in future studies”\n",
      "Further research needed to be done to determine the mechanism that could underlie these findings, she explained, adding:\n",
      "“We need to examine how statins affect cholesterol, brain cholesterol and brain connectivity, and how the effects change with short or long-term treatment. We need to understand which patients potentially benefit from statins, if at all, in order to design a targeted clinical trial. We need to know how different genotypes (e.g. ApoE) modify this response. ApoE is a cholesterol transporter and the genetic [risk of Alzheimer’s the] allele ApoE4 confers [is higher].”\n",
      "Dr. Segil, who was not involved in this research, said he wanted to see more data comparing the different types of statin: “This study investigated three different generic cholesterol-lowering medications, or ‘statins,’ which include rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin. I am intrigued to see long term follow-up in the patients who received these three medications to see if data supports neurologists like me using one of these over another [drug], due to data indicating one statin helps prevent memory loss more than another.“\n",
      "“As a family of medications, statins often are not [well] tolerated, and rosuvastatin in clinical practice is better tolerated than atorvastatin, and I would be interested in seeing if rosuvastatin helped patients with memory loss in a follow-up study head to head with atorvastatin,” he pointed out.\n",

      "Although the exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, doctors consider it an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. This means that inflammation is at the root of this condition.\n",
      "Up to 3% of adults in the United States have psoriasis. It causes skin symptoms, such as raised plaques and discoloration, and can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints and eyes.\n",
      "Experts believe inflammation is the common factor that can affect these different areas.\n",
      "What causes inflammation in psoriasis?\n",
      "In people with psoriasis, immune system dysfunction causes inflammatory cells to build up in the middle layer of the skin, known as the dermis. The condition also speeds the growth of skin cells in the epidermis, the outer skin layer.\n",
      "Typically, skin cells grow and flake off in the span of a month. This process speeds up to just a few days in people with psoriasis. Instead of shedding, skin cells pile up on the skin’s surface, leading to uncomfortable symptoms such as raised plaques, scales, swelling, and redness or discoloration.\n",
      "Even though psoriasis is a skin condition, the inflammation associated with psoriasis affects the entire body. It can increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriatic arthritis.\n",
      "Is there a way to treat inflammation?\n",
      "Although inflammation in psoriasis is due to immune system dysregulation, studies suggest that people can reduce this inflammation through lifestyle and dietary changes. This can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.\n",
      "Using these methods, many people who have psoriasis can maintain remission, which is a long period without experiencing psoriasis symptoms.\n",
      "Additionally, certain medications to treat psoriasis work by reducing inflammation. These include topical corticosteroids, injectable biologics, and oral medications.\n",
      "Everyone with psoriasis is different. Some people will require more extensive treatment than others.\n",
      "How to manage inflammation\n",
      "While there is currently no cure for psoriasis, the following habits may help reduce psoriasis-related inflammation and increase a person’s chances of experiencing remission.\n",
      "Diet is strongly linked to systemic inflammation. Studies suggest that certain inflammatory dietary patterns can increase the risk of psoriasis and worsen symptoms.\n",
      "A nutritious diet looks different for everyone. However, the following steps may help a person establish one:\n",
      "Obesity is a risk factor for psoriasis development. People with psoriasis who have overweight or obesity may also experience more severe symptoms than people with a moderate weight.\n",
      "Weight loss may reduce inflammatory markers and help reduce psoriasis symptoms in people with excess body weight.\n",
      "A 2020 study found that people with psoriasis and overweight or obesity who reduced their body weight by 12% through a 10-week program experienced a 50–75% reduction in psoriasis severity. Participants experienced an average weight loss of 23 pounds.\n",
      "Several habits can help reduce inflammation and improve psoriasis symptoms, such as:\n",
      "When to seek medical help\n",
      "Anyone experiencing a psoriasis flare who is interested in learning ways to reduce psoriasis symptoms and inflammation may wish to consider speaking with their healthcare team, including their dermatologist.\n",
      "They can recommend treatment methods based on symptom severity and provide recommendations for diet and lifestyle changes that may help lower inflammation and reduce psoriasis symptoms. They may also suggest taking vitamins or supplements.\n",
      "There is currently no cure for cirrhosis of the liver and the disease can increase the risk for complications.\n",
      "A new study reports around 10% of older U.S. veterans diagnosed with dementia have misdiagnosed hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease.\n",
      "Cognitive decline due to hepatic encephalopathy is treatable and\n",
      "potentially reversible.\n",
      "Scientists believe their findings highlight the importance of screening patients with cognitive impairment for liver disease.\n",
      "As of 2017, about 112 million people around the world have the progressive liver disease cirrhosis.\n",
      "Researchers estimate that liver diseases including cirrhosis account for 4% of all deaths globally.\n",
      "There is currently no cure for cirrhosis. As the disease progresses, it can increase a person’s risk for certain complications including:\n",
      "Now researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University report that as many as 10% of older U.S. veterans diagnosed with dementia instead have misdiagnosed hepatic encephalopathy, which is treatable and potentially reversible.\n",
      "Scientists believe their findings — recently published in the journal JAMA Network Open — highlight the importance of screening patients with cognitive impairment for liver disease.\n",
      "How liver disease impacts cognitive function\n",
      "According to Dr. Jasmohan S. Bajaj, professor in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in the Department of Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University and Richmond VA Medical Center, and lead author of this study, people with cirrhosis often have a condition called hepatic encephalopathy which can impact almost 60% of those tested.\n",
      "“This can cause subclinical and overt symptoms such as mental slowing, tremors, confusion, and even coma,” Dr. Bajaj explained to Medical News Today. “This is partly because of the liver’s inability to clear the gut-derived toxins and also through inflammation that ultimately results in brain dysfunction.”\n",
      "Dr. Bajaj said they decided to focus specifically on the veteran population because there can be confusion between hepatic encephalopathy, dementia, or both in this population.\n",
      "“To support this hypothesis, we have several lines of evidence that prompted this study,” Dr. Bajaj continued.\n",
      "“One, older patients with already diagnosed cirrhosis are more likely to develop a ‘dementia-like’ state. Two, brain dysfunction due to dementia and that related to cirrhosis often overlap and synergize to worsen (the) quality of life in affected patients. Three, gut-brain axis changes in people over 65 years old point towards a role of microbial changes regardless of cirrhosis. And four, we have found that a couple of patients that were deemed to be dementia actually had hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy improved their mental function.”\n",
      "— Dr. Jasmohan S. Bajaj, lead study author\n",
      "10% of veterans with dementia may have cirrhosis\n",
      "For this study, Dr. Bajaj and his team analyzed medical records data of more than 177,000 U.S. veterans diagnosed with dementia but not cirrhosis between 2009 and 2019.\n",
      "Researchers focused on the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score of the study participants. FIB-4 is a tool used by doctors to assess a person’s liver disease risk using a person’s age and three specific biomarkers:\n",
      "Depending on a person’s score they may be considered at a low, intermediate, or high risk for advanced liver fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis.\n",
      "Researchers found that 10.3% of the veterans with dementia had high FIB-4 scores, meaning they were very likely to have cirrhosis.\n",
      "“This unexpected link between dementia and liver health emphasizes the importance of screening patients for potentially treatable contributors to cognitive decline,” Dr. Bajaj says.\n",
      "Screening for liver disease in older adults\n",
      "Dr. Bajaj said these findings highlight the importance of screening people for reversible cognitive decline caused by cirrhosis.\n",
      "“If 10% have cirrhosis and even 50% of those have a component of treatable hepatic encephalopathy, this is still a large group of patients that could gain some of their mental acuities with easy therapy,” Dr. Bajaj explained.\n",
      "“In addition, patients with cirrhosis are also at higher risk for other complications such as liver cancer, which can be screened for and treated but only if cirrhosis is suspected,” he continued.\n",
      "The study also reported on a disparity in the amount of potentially undiagnosed cirrhosis in veterans with dementia living in urban areas, who were of Hispanic descent, and who were not white.\n",
      "“This underlines another focus of where we should all be doing better to improve disparities and also educate patients, family members, and clinicians about the risk of cirrhosis and dementia sooner,” Dr. Bajaj said.\n",
      "“We plan to try and replicate this in a non-veteran population as well as determining biomarkers for diagnosis of whether the subject with mental dysfunction has dementia, cirrhosis-related problems, or both,” he added.\n",
      "Treating cognitive decline caused by liver disease\n",
      "After reviewing this study, Dr. David Frank, a neurologist at Hackensack Meridian Neuroscience Institute at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, told MNT that this study brings to attention a potentially clinically useful screening tool for a subset of these patients.\n",
      "“Although we are beginning to see more useful medications for the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia, the primary focus in initial evaluation remains the identification of potentially reversible/treatable underlying causes, and an algorithm that may identify more of such patients is certainly welcome,” Dr. Frank said.\n",
      "MNT also spoke with Dr. Anurag Maheshwari, gastroenterologist and hepatologist at The Center for Liver and Hepatobiliary Diseases, part of The Melissa L. Posner Institute for Digestive Health & Liver Disease, at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, MD, about this study.\n",
      "Dr. Maheshwari commented that the study highlights an important concept, which is that providers who are diagnosing patients with dementia need to be aware that hepatic encephalopathy can mimic dementia.\n",
      "“It’s a matter of having better tools and awareness and education … to alert providers about the fact that if patients look like they’re having possible dementia, it may not be dementia — it may be hepatic encephalopathy and that’s something you have to be on the lookout for. The main purpose of the study is to provide better provider education amongst the folks who treat patients with neurocognitive decline but are not dealing with liver disease on a daily basis.”\n",

      "Better cardiorespiratory health may lower the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer, according to a new Swedish study.\n",
      "While many men develop prostate cancer, few die from it, and the study does not make a connection between cardiorespiratory health and prostate cancer deaths.\n",
      "A connection between cardiorespiratory fitness and prostate diagnosis is most likely due to being in better overall health, say experts.\n",
      "A new study of Swedish men has found a strong link between cardiorespiratory health and a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.\n",
      "The study finds that as little as a 3% improvement in cardiorespiratory health can result in a reduction in prostate cancer risk by 35%.\n",
      "With its focus on the risk of developing the common male cancer, the study does not make any assertions regarding cardiorespiratory fitness and the chances of dying from prostate cancer.\n",
      "Prostate cancer is very common among men, particularly men aged 65 and older. One in eight men eventually develop the disease, and it is the second leading cause of death in men, behind lung cancer. About one in 44 men will die of prostate cancer.\n",
      "However, the cancer is often very slow-growing, and most men who receive a prostate cancer diagnosis do not die of the disease.\n",
      "There is robust debate whether the best course of action upon diagnosis is surgical prostate removal (prostatectomy), radiation therapy, or doing nothing at all apart from keep in an eye on it.\n",
      "Doctors track the presence of prostate cancer and receive an indication of its severity through blood work, including a prostate antigen test (PSA).\n",
      "The results of the study appear in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n",
      "Who do the findings apply to?\n",
      "The study was an analysis of Swedish health records in which 57,652 men reported their physical activity levels, self-described health, lifestyle, and body mass and height measurements.\n",
      "Each had also participated in at least two cardiorespiratory fitness tests on a stationary bicycle, with their cardiorespiratory fitness measure a V02 max test, which tracks oxygen inhaled and exhaled oxygen at maximum exercise levels.\n",
      "During a mean followup time of 6.7 years, 46 men died of prostate cancer.\n",
      "While Sweden’s health system provides excellent data for such studies, one concern is that the group of men studied is largely White Scandinavian men.\n",
      "Black men — who are at the highest risk of prostate cancer — were not included.\n",
      "Cardiologist Dr. Jayne Morgan, of GeoVax, who was not involved in this study, mentioned this as a key concern when speaking to Medical News Today. Yet this was not her only concern about the research.\n",
      "Dr. Morgan noted a lack of information regarding “whether men with higher fitness levels or higher cardiorespiratory fitness also have different health habits with regard to types of food consumed, amounts of sleep obtained, hobbies, level of engagement with the medical establishment, obesity, employment — these men were all employed — and other lifestyle choices that can impact health and even cancer risk.”\n",
      "Urologist and urologic oncologist Dr. Ramkishen Narayanan, from the Center for Urologic Health at the Disney Family Cancer Center in Burbank, CA, also not involved in the research, did, however, appreciate that the study focused on diagnosis of prostate cancer, and not mortality, since the number of men who die is so low that meaningful analysis is difficult.\n",
      "“You’re talking about 1% at a mean followup of seven years. So that followup is not terribly long and the numbers are small,” he said.\n",
      "Why is cardiorespiratory fitness important to prostate cancer risk?\n",
      "Dr. Narayanan said he suspected a benefit from cardiorespiratory fitness would mostly be due to being healthier in general, mentioning its positive value for avoiding metabolic syndrome.\n",
      "“Those are modifiable risk factors,” said Dr. Narayanan. “High blood pressure and obesity we know are risk factors that can contribute to different oncologic potential.”\n",
      "Specifically, said Dr. Morgan, “[g]reater cardiac fitness is generally tied to greater overall fitness which is then tied to decreased abdominal fat, decreased weight, less insulin resistance, i.e. less type 2 diabetes [risk], and improved cholesterol profiles.”\n",
      "Dr. Morgan explained that “[t]he common thread is chronic systemic inflammation, which is a risk factor for both cancer as well as heart disease.”\n",
      "“Interestingly,” she noted, “cardiac disease is the leading cause of death in men with prostate cancer.”\n",
      "Dr. Morgan also pointed out that for men being treated for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) there is an increase in cardiovascular risk.\n",
      "What is the takeaway?\n",
      "Dr. Morgan listed the items she would like to see addressed in a subsequent, more robust study. These are:\n",
      "Dr. Narayanan suggested essentially turning the study around, an idea also suggested by its authors: “I would look at a population with prostate cancer, and look at biochemical recurrence to observe whether strong [cardiorespiratory fitness] would align with a reduction in biochemical recurrence of the disease.”\n",
      "After anybody gets treated for prostate cancer, their PSA levels are regularly monitored indefinitely.\n",
      "“The biggest takeaway that I would have from this is that [promoting] cardiovascular fitness is something actionable and empowering that men can do as opposed to saying, well, it’s family history, it’s your genetic predisposition, and then feeling like they’re not able to take some preventable action.”\n",
      "– Dr. Ramkishen Narayanan\n",
      "He also mentioned that some men are fearful of working on cardiorespiratory fitness for fear of raising testosterone levels that they worry may increase their risk of prostate cancer.\n",
      "“There’s a misconception,” explained Dr. Narayanan, “that increasing testosterone will increase your prostate cancer incidence. That’s really been disproven as a misconception. So that’s something that’s important to know.”\n",
      "The number of people experiencing kidney stones is growing worldwide.\n",
      "This number is expected to grow due to an increase in diseases that can raise a person’s kidney stone risk, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "Researchers have found that SGLT2 inhibitors — which are used to treat type 2 diabetes — may help lower a person’s risk of developing kidney stones.\n",
      "As of 2019, there were more than 115 million cases of kidney stones around the world.\n",
      "Medically known as nephrolithiasis, kidney stones are mineral deposits that form in the kidneys that are too large to easily pass through the urinary tract.\n",
      "Previous research shows the prevalence of kidney stones is growing globally due to an increase in diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, which can raise a person’s kidney stone risk.\n",
      "Now, researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital have found that a type of medication called sodium-glucose contratransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors used to treat type 2 diabetes may help lower a person’s risk of developing kidney stones.\n",
      "The study was recently published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\n",
      "What are SGLT2 inhibitors?\n",
      "SGLT2 inhibitors are a newer class of medications used to help manage blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "Taken orally, the medication stops glucose in the blood that is filtered through the kidneys from being reabsorbed by the body. This causes the extra blood sugar to leave the body through urine, lowering blood sugar levels.\n",
      "Sometimes SGLT2 inhibitors are also prescribed for treating chronic kidney disease and to help reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.\n",
      "Past studies have linked SGLT2 inhibitor use to weight loss, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and reduced risk for stroke and heart disease.\n",
      "A new class of medication for kidney stones\n",
      "Dr. Julie Paik, associate professor of medicine in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics and the Division of Renal (Kidney) Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, and corresponding author of this study, said her research group decided to examine SGLT2 inhibitors as a possible way to lower kidney stone risk because they had already been studying this newer class of diabetes medications for several years.\n",
      "“We became interested in studying the association between the use of this class of drugs and (the) risk of kidney stones based on what we had been seeing clinically with the use of this medication class, our current understanding of the pathophysiology of this drug class, and prior studies, albeit limited,” Dr. Paik told Medical News Today.\n",
      "“Kidney stones are common, and in addition to being quite painful, they can cause kidney damage and increase the risk of other sequelae, like urinary tract infections, cardiovascular disease, and (bone) fractures,” she continued.\n",
      "“It’s unclear why rates are on the rise, but some possible factors could be the rising rate of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diet-related factors,” she said.\n",
      "25–30% lower kidney stone risk with SGLT2\n",
      "For this study, Dr. Paik and her team analyzed data from more than 716,000 adults with type 2 diabetes who had started taking either an SGLT2 inhibitor or two other classes of diabetes medications — glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1 receptor) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors.\n",
      "Upon analysis, scientists found that people who began taking SGLT2 inhibitors had a 31% decreased risk of developing kidney stones compared to those taking GLP1-receptor agonists and a 25% lower risk than people taking DPP4 inhibitors.\n",
      "Researchers report that the findings were consistent across sex, race/ethnicity, history of chronic kidney disease, and obesity.\n",
      "“While we found a lower risk of kidney stones in our study, we don’t fully understand how they lower the risk,” Dr. Paik said. “While we provide some potential explanations in our study, it remains to be studied further. We will continue to investigate the role of these newer classes of drugs and health outcomes.”\n",
      "Larger studies needed\n",
      "After reviewing this research, Dr. Jennifer Cheng, section chief of endocrinology at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, told MNT that this study is promising in helping doctors decide what medications to recommend to their diabetes patients.\n",
      "“This can be helpful for patients with type 2 diabetes and renal stones, which can reduce (the) risks of renal stones and prevent hospitalizations,” Dr. Cheng continued. “It is helpful for patients to reduce their risk for nephrolithiasis, as it is a cause of significant pain and discomfort for patients.”\n",
      "“This could be another good reason to prescribe the SGLT2 class of medications and for patients to inquire about if they have had renal stones in the past,” she added. “Implementing a new way of lowering renal stone risk is always helpful, especially in patients who do not have other options.”\n",
      "Dr. Cheng said that thorough research can be done using larger studies to determine if there are significant differences between the different SGLT2 class of medications and if there are reproducible studies showing a reduction in renal stones.\n",
      "“Physicians also often recommend when people are prescribed SGLT2 class medications, that patients drink enough fluids and that may also contribute to the reduction of stones. We would like to see if it is an effect of the medication or the increased fluid intake that occurs.”— Dr. Jennifer Cheng\n",
      "Tips for lowering kidney stone risk\n",
      "Dr. Cheng said there are several things that predispose patients to getting kidney stones, including obesity, lack of exercise, dehydration, and eating foods with too much salt and sugar.\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the obesity epidemic has only increased the risk of patients having renal stones,” she continued.\n",
      "“Certain food choices, such as too much sugar and too much salt increase the risk of renal stones. It has been found that too much fructose also increases (the) risk of developing kidney stones as well.”— Dr. Jennifer Cheng\n",
      "“Not drinking enough water also may increase the risk of renal stones. People are so busy sometimes that they don’t always remember to drink enough. The older you are, the less thirst mechanism you have, and therefore you drink less,” Dr. Cheng added.\n",
      "A recent preliminary study highlights a promising development in stroke recovery treatment.\n",
      "Researchers found that ischemic stroke patients—those experiencing strokes caused by blood clots—demonstrated improvements in cognitive function in the early recovery phase when administered intravenous injections of a ginkgo biloba extract within the first two weeks following their stroke.\n",
      "This discovery underscores the potential of traditional remedies in modern medical practices and sparks a dialogue on integrating such treatments into stroke recovery protocols\n",
      "According to a preliminary study, presented at the 2024 International Stroke Conference, individuals experiencing ischemic stroke showed improved cognitive function in the early stages of recovery when treated with intravenous injections containing a mix of active components from ginkgo biloba in the initial two weeks following the stroke.\n",
      "Extracted from the dried leaves and seeds of the ginkgo tree, which is among the oldest living tree species native to East Asia, ginkgo biloba is a herb celebrated in traditional Chinese medicine and also available as a dietary supplement in the United States.\n",
      "In China, intravenous (IV) therapies utilizing the active compounds of ginkgo biloba are commonly employed for stroke treatment, attributed to its potential antioxidant properties that could safeguard neurons against damage.\n",
      "However, the FDA has not sanctioned ginkgo biloba for any medical application, and, as per the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (part of the National Institutes of Health), there is not currently sufficient evidence to approve its use.\n",
      "Helping stroke patients recover cognitive function\n",
      "In this new study involving 3,163 individuals who had experienced mild to moderate blockage-related strokes, researchers investigated how their cognitive function recovered post-stroke.\n",
      "These participants, who were, on average, 63 years old and 36% of whom were women, received treatment across 100 facilities in China.\n",
      "Within the first 48 hours after their stroke, around half were randomly chosen to get a daily IV shot of 25 mg of a ginkgo biloba-derived mixture known as GDLM for two weeks. The rest were given a placebo shot daily for the same duration.\n",
      "Researchers evaluated their mental abilities using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a direct, 30-point test often used for stroke patients, at the start, after two weeks, and then after three months.\n",
      "Initially, before any treatment and just after their stroke, the average mental capability score of these patients was moderately low, at 17 out of 30.\n",
      "How ginkgo biloba improves cognitive function\n",
      "After two weeks, those who had received the ginkgo biloba extract shots showed more improvement in their mental function scores than those who had been given the placebo, with scores increasing by an average of 3.93 points compared to 3.62 points.\n",
      "By the 90th day, the gap widened further, with the ginkgo biloba group showing a more significant increase in mental function scores, averaging a 5.51 point improvement, versus a 5.04 point increase in the placebo group.\n",
      "The researchers explained that the group receiving GDLM saw a 20% higher rate of patients achieving a clinically meaningful level of cognitive improvement, suggesting that GDLM injections could enhance cognitive functions in those experiencing acute ischemic stroke.\n",
      "They noted, however, that the study’s follow-up period was limited to 90 days, implying the necessity for more extended research to understand the long-term impacts of GDLM treatments.\n",
      "Further elaborating on the benefits, the researchers mentioned that GDLM appears to offer neuroprotection through various mechanisms.\n",
      "These include widening the brain’s blood vessels, enhancing the brain cells’ ability to withstand low oxygen levels, and boosting cerebral blood flow.\n",
      "They also highlighted that GDLM possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic (preventing cell death) effects.\n",
      "Do alternative medicines have any risks?\n",
      "The 2022 American Heart Association Scientific Statement on the use of complementary and alternative medicines in heart failure management highlighted that while there may be benefits, there are also significant risks associated with these treatments, underscoring the importance of involving healthcare professionals in decision-making.\n",
      "Experts emphasized that the recommendations for the cautious use of supplements in heart failure patients should similarly apply to the treatment of all cardiovascular diseases, including stroke.\n",
      "They advise against stroke patients using gingko biloba or any supplements without consulting their healthcare providers.\n",
      "While the research on ginkgo biloba might hold promise for post-stroke care in the future, its effectiveness and safety must be proven through clinical trials to meet the rigorous standards required for FDA approval.\n",
      "Dr. José Morales, vascular neurologist and neurointerventional surgeon at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in this research, told Medical News Today that “Gingko biloba has a long history of associated effects on moderately boosting cognitive function.”\n",
      "“The strength of this study lies in the study design (i.e., double-blind randomized clinical control trial) and in those with a sentinel event (i.e., acute ischemic stroke) that is known to affect cognition long-term,” he said.\n",
      "“However, the effect size is not disclosed in this abstract, so more information is needed to evaluate the strength of the findings. In addition, the study is not an international trial, so the generalizability of the findings to diverse populations are in question,” he added.\n",
      "Rachael Miller, a nutritionist, herbalist, and the founder of Zhi Herbals, who was also not involved in the study, told MNT that “it is well known that the terpene lactones in ginkgo are largely responsible for its ability to reduce inflammation and enhance mental acuity and memory.”\n",
      "Miller pointed to previous research that supports ginkgo’s ability to protect damaged neurons after ischemia.\n",
      "“This new study is exciting, and it aligns with the results of previous research done regarding ginkgo and ischemic damage.”— Rachel Miller\n",
      "Should I take over-the-counter gingko biloba?\n",
      "Dr. Morales points out that “Ginkgo biloba has putative mechanisms of action that protect neurons against beta-amyloid neurotoxicity, hypoxemia, and oxidative stress.”\n",
      "“The authors should be lauded for completing this trial and demonstrating clinically significant outcomes, which are often elusive even with plausible mechanisms of action. Future research should be conducted at multiple sites internationally with diverse populations to verify and validate these findings, as well as to determine the safest and most effective dose. Conducting international trials would boost credibility and facilitate approval to large clinical populations at need should the results be replicated at that scale.”— Dr. José Morales\n",
      "Miller notes that “the improvement in MoCa scores is significant and can offer hope to those [experiencing] the lasting results of acute ischemic stroke.”\n",
      "“It would be difficult for a layperson to replicate the results at home, as the injection method is not accessible to most, and ginkgo supplements usually do not have their lactone content standardized or labelled. The content of ginkgo leaves varies greatly depending on how they are harvested,” Miller explained.\n",
      "However, it’s important to note that Dr. Morales said, “patients and the public should wait for additional information from this trial and/or subsequent ones before adopting a regimen with over-the-counter gingko biloba supplements, particularly given known ginkgo-related safety issues and drug-drug interactions.”\n",
      "Cinnamon, a spice from the inner bark of trees from the genus Cinnamomum, is widely used in cooking.\n",
      "It is also taken as a food supplement, with health benefits that may include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects.\n",
      "Adding to the evidence for potential antidiabetic effects, a new study has found that a 4-week course of cinnamon supplements reduced blood glucose (sugar) levels in people with obesity or overweight and prediabetes.\n",
      "Cinnamon has been used since around 2800 Before the Common Era (BCE) as a flavoring, an anointing oil and for medicinal purposes. The Romans used it to treat digestive and respiratory ailments, and the ancient Egyptians used it for fragrance and flavoring.\n",
      "More recently, the health benefits of cinnamon have been widely investigated. Studies suggest that the spice may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial and even anticancer effects.\n",
      "Now, in a double-blind crossover study, researchers have found that cinnamon supplements could help to reduce blood glucose (sugar) levels in people with obesity or overweight and prediabetes.\n",
      "The findings are published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n",
      "Kelsey Costa, a registered dietitian nutritionist and nutrition consultant for Diabetes Strong, not involved in this study, commented on its methods for Medical News Today. She told us:\n",
      "“While the study’s cohort was chosen to explore the effects of cinnamon on glucose regulation in individuals with prediabetes and obesity, its applicability to a broader demographic requires caution. The small sample size limits the robustness of the conclusions and reflects the need for larger, more representative studies.”\n",
      "“However,” Costa added, “this research utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which adds a novel and more precise dimension to our understanding of cinnamon’s impact on blood sugar levels.”\n",
      "Can 4 grams of cinnamon daily help manage obesity, prediabetes?\n",
      "Previous studies into the effect of cinnamon on blood glucose levels have shown inconsistent findings, although a 2023 umbrella meta-analysis did find that cinnamon supplements reduced fasting blood glucose.\n",
      "The researchers recruited 18 people with overweight or obesity — mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.5 — and prediabetes — a condition where blood glucose levels are consistently high, which can lead to type 2 diabetes — for a 4-week randomized, double-blind crossover trial of cinnamon supplementation.\n",
      "First, they put the participants on a 2-week, low polyphenol “beige“ diet — a type of diet rich in simple carbohydrates — and told them to avoid any foods containing cinnamon. They then divided the participants randomly into a treatment group and a placebo group.\n",
      "They gave each group 16 visually identical capsules per day, 8 to be taken with breakfast and 8 with dinner. The treatment group capsules contained a total of 4 grams (g) of cinnamon, while each placebo capsule contained only maltodextrin (250 milligrams), making a total of 4 g maltodextrin daily.\n",
      "The researchers told the participants to continue their diet, and take the capsules as instructed for 4 weeks.\n",
      "After 4 weeks, the groups did a 2-week “washout“ phase when they took no capsules, before swapping groups. Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving cinnamon and who was receiving placebo.\n",
      "Both Costa and Dr. Menka Gupta, functional medicine doctor at Nutra Nourish, neither of whom were involved in the study, expressed concern about the use of maltodextrin as placebo.\n",
      "Dr. Gupta commented: “Maltodextrin has been shown to increase blood glucose due to its high glycemic index. This could have potentially accentuated the difference between the cinnamon and placebo groups.”\n",
      "Costa explained: “Typically, maltodextrin is used in placebo-controlled studies due to its neutral flavor and similarity in appearance to the supplement being tested; however, given that maltodextrin can cause a glycemic response due to the body’s rapid conversion of it to glucose, there could be a concern that its utilization might have confounded the study’s results.”\n",
      "“To ensure the validity and reliability of the outcomes, future research could benefit from selecting a non-glycemic placebo or transparently accounting for the potential effects of maltodextrin in the study’s analysis and discussion,” she advised.\n",
      "We reached out to the authors for comment, but they did not respond to our request in time for publication.\n",
      "Cinnamon shows promise in blood glucose control\n",
      "The researchers monitored the participants’ blood glucose levels using a continuous glucose monitoring device fixed to the upper arm, which measured glucose levels every 15 minutes.\n",
      "In addition, at 4 time points in the study — after the 2-week introductory diet, after the first 4-week trial, after washout, and after the second 4-week trial — the participants gave blood samples for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n",
      "Researchers took blood samples after participants had fasted for 8–12 hours, then gave them 75 g of glucose cola to drink, plus 8 capsules of cinnamon or placebo. They took further blood samples every 30 minutes for 3 hours.\n",
      "Continuous glucose monitoring showed that participants taking cinnamon had consistently lower levels of blood glucose, and lower glucose peaks than those on placebo. However, there was no difference in the OGTT between the two groups.\n",
      "The researchers suggest this is because continuous monitoring is a more sensitive measure of glucose changes.\n",
      "Why might cinnamon help with blood sugar?\n",
      "“The significant decrease in blood glucose levels seen with a 4g daily intake of cinnamon could be attributed to its rich polyphenol content and diverse bioactive compounds, which include cinnamaldehyde, proanthocyanidins, catechins, coumarin, trans-cinnamic acid, and various flavonoids. […] These natural compounds boost insulin’s ability to connect with cells, prompting them to take in glucose more effectively. They also reduce harmful inflammation and support the liver in storing excess glucose as glycogen for future energy needs.”\n",

      "The researchers also propose that the impact of cinnamon on the gut microbiome — encouraging growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting growth of others — may affect blood glucose.\n",
      "Dr. Gupta agreed.\n",
      "“Cinnamon could improve gut health: Beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can enhance gut barrier function, reducing systemic inflammation. Lower inflammation is associated with improved insulin sensitivity,” she explained.\n",
      "“Beneficial bacteria ferment dietary fibers to produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which can improve glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating energy expenditure and storage,” she added.\n",
      "Expert tips to manage prediabetes\n",
      "Dr. Gupta advised that cinnamon might have a role to play in managing prediabetes. “Adding cinnamon to the diet can blunt the blood glucose increase and can be beneficial part of a balanced diet for people with prediabetes,” she said.\n",
      "“However,” she cautioned, “cinnamon contains coumarin, which can be toxic at high levels.”\n",
      "Costa recommended other evidence-based measures to help control prediabetes: “Embracing diets rich in healthy plant-based foods, engaging in guided intermittent fasting, and practicing intuitive and mindful eating can improve nutrition while enhancing overall metabolic health.”\n",
      "“Weight loss achieved by combining a healthy, reduced-calorie diet with regular exercise has been shown to be twice as effective as weight loss achieved through diet alone in reversing prediabetic states. Moreover, reducing abdominal fat is essential due to its strong association with insulin resistance,” added Costa.\n",

      "Sleeping for more or less than the optimal duration of 7 to 9 hours is associated with an increased risk of dementia and stroke.\n",
      "Brain imaging biomarkers that measure structural changes in the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can predict the onset of stroke or dementia years before they occur.\n",
      "A new study shows that suboptimal sleep duration is associated with an increased presence of brain biomarkers of dementia and stroke in healthy middle-aged individuals.\n",
      "This study further underscores the role of suboptimal sleep duration in brain health and the need to improve sleep hygiene.\n",
      "Experts recommend that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. Indeed, studies have shown that sleeping 7 to 8 hours a night is favorably associated with health while shorter or longer sleep durations are linked with adverse health outcomes. Suboptimal sleep duration is also a risk factor for stroke and dementia.\n",
      "A new study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association now shows that healthy individuals aged 40 to 69 years sleeping more or less than the optimal duration were more likely to show elevated expression of brain biomarkers of stroke and dementia.\n",
      "Study author Dr. Santiago Clocchiatti-Tuozzo, a postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Medicine, noted that these results further support the role of sleep in long-term health.\n",
      "Dr. Clocchiatti-Tuozzo explained to Medical News Today that, “[b]ecause these magnetic resonance imaging markers of poor brain health are known to precede the occurrence of stroke and dementia by many years, there may be merit in assessing and managing abnormal sleep duration among asymptomatic middle‐aged adults.”\n",
      "“Both short and long sleep durations may potentially be modifiable risk factors for magnetic resonance imaging markers of poor brain health,” added Dr. Clocchiatti-Tuozzo.\n",
      "How does sleep duration affect health?\n",
      "Studies have consistently shown that insufficient or excessive sleep is linked to an increased risk of conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and depression.\n",
      "The link between suboptimal sleep with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases has led the American Heart Association to include sleep among the eight key components that constitute Life’s Essential 8.\n",
      "Life’s Essential 8 consists of measurable components such as sleep, diet, and physical exercise that influence the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "Studies have shown that suboptimal sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular conditions like stroke and coronary artery disease.\n",
      "Similarly, shorter sleep duration in midlife is also associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia later in life.\n",
      "Dr. José Morales, a vascular neurologist and neurointerventional surgeon at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, noted that studies conducted so far have not shown a link between sleep duration and brain health.\n",
      "Dr. Morales, who was not involved in the current study, explained:\n",
      "“Long sleep duration has in the past been associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity. However, these historical findings did not explicitly implicate compromised brain health.”\n",
      "In the present study, the researchers examined whether suboptimal sleep duration was associated with brain health in healthy individuals without stroke or dementia aged over 40.\n",
      "How are stroke and dementia related?\n",
      "Stroke and dementia are preceded by structural changes in the brain’s white matter, which is made up of nerve fibers or axons that transmit information between nerve cells.\n",
      "These changes in the structure of white matter include white matter hyperintensities and fractional anisotropy, which can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",
      "White matter hyperintensities appear as bright white spots during MRI scans. White matter hyperintensities are more frequent with increasing age and are often caused by damage to the white matter owing to the disease of small blood vessels in the brain.\n",
      "Fractional anisotropy is a measure of white matter integrity. Decreased white matter integrity and white matter hyperintensities are observed several years before a stroke or onset of dementia, thus serving as biomarkers for these conditions.\n",
      "Suboptimal sleep linked to marker of dementia, stroke\n",
      "The present study consisted of 39,771 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank study between 2006 and 2010. The UK Biobank is a long-term population-based study designed to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors in disease development.\n",
      "These participants were aged 40 to 69 at the time of enrollment (baseline) in the UK Biobank study. The researchers used MRI to scan the participants’ brains for changes in white matter at an average of 9 years after enrollment.\n",
      "The researchers used self-reported sleep duration data collected at the time of enrollment and at the end of the follow-up period, that is, during the brain scans. Sleep duration was calculated by averaging the total time spent sleeping daily, including time spent napping during the daytime.\n",
      "Individuals sleeping between seven and less than nine hours daily were categorized as sleeping for the optimal duration. Participants receiving less than 7 hours or in excess of 9 hours of sleep were classified as sleeping for an inadequate or excessive duration, respectively.\n",
      "Individuals with stroke or dementia were excluded from the study due to the brain damage associated with these conditions.\n",
      "Based on the sleep duration interviews conducted at the time of enrollment, the researchers found that the participants who slept less or more than the optimal duration were more likely to show greater signs of damage to white matter than those sleeping for an optimal duration.\n",
      "Specifically, suboptimal sleep duration was associated with a larger volume of white matter hyperintensities (lesions) and a greater decline in white matter integrity.\n",
      "Similar results were obtained in a follow-up analysis when the sleep duration at the time of the brain scans was used to assess the association between sleep and white matter damage.\n",
      "In addition, the association between sleep duration and white matter damage was also observed after adjusting the analysis for several variables, including age, sex, body mass index, and cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking.\n",
      "The study thus shows that suboptimal sleep duration could potentially have an adverse impact on brain health. However, whether this link is causal needs to be established.\n",
      "Dr. Clocchiatti-Tuozzo noted that “[b]etter understanding of the directionality and mechanisms of the association between suboptimal sleep and poor brain health is needed, as well as clinical trials aimed at unveiling whether early interventions on sleep duration during middle age can potentially benefit brain health later in life.”\n",
      "More data needed going forward\n",
      "The large number of participants included in this brain imaging study was a major strength of the study. Such a large sample size is generally uncommon for imaging studies.\n",
      "Dr. Balaji Krishnaiah, Neurology Medical Director at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis, TN, not involved in the current study, commented that:\n",
      "“The study is one of the largest population health studies globally, with nearly 40,000 middle-aged participants from the UK Biobank, adding robustness to the findings. The prospective nature of the study, assessing sleep duration approximately 9 years before neuroimaging, provides temporal depth to the results.”\n",
      "Nevertheless, one of the study’s major limitations was its observational design. Dr. Clocchiatti-Tuozzo said that: “Due to the observational nature of our study, we are precluded from making causal inferences between sleep duration and poor brain health. In addition, the directionality of such a causal relationship remains indeterminate.”\n",
      "“The generalizability of our results is limited by the characteristics of the UK Biobank study, which is being conducted in a single European country and may be prone to healthy volunteer bias, where individuals who are willing and able to participate in a study tend to be healthier than the source population,” he added.\n",
      "Dr. Morales also noted: “It is a retrospective study using self-reported sleep durations, and the latter may not be reliable data inputs. Future research should incorporate objective measures of sleep duration (rather than self-reported) — and more importantly sleep quality — for correlation with these imaging biomarkers.”\n",
      "Physical activity might not play as prominent a role in reducing the risk or preventing cognitive decline as previously thought, according to a new study.\n",
      "Even though the researchers reported that physical activity had a weak association with lowering the risk of cognitive decline, they said even a slight reduction can be helpful.\n",
      "The researchers note that the studies included in the meta-analysis have shortcomings but do not believe the low quality of the studies significantly altered the results.\n",
      "Physical activity is associated with a lower the risk of cognitive decline.\n",
      "However, according to a meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Network Open, the effect might not be as strong as previously thought.\n",
      "The study examined whether physical activity is associated with cognitive decline and whether there is a dose-response association between physical activity and cognition.\n",
      "The scientists concluded that physical activity might postpone cognitive decline, but only to a small extent.\n",
      "The weaker association remained, even when looking at the preceding levels of cognition or age of the participant.\n",
      "Details from the study on exercise and cognitive decline\n",
      "Researchers looked at 104 studies with a total of 341,741 participants.\n",
      "The study’s analysis of binary outcomes included 45 studies with a total of 102,452 participants.\n",
      "When looking specifically at follow-up global cognition, they reviewed data from 14 studies that included 41,045 participants. When evaluating changes in global cognition, they included 25 studies with 67,643 individuals.\n",
      "Evaluating global cognition looks at many cognitive domains, such as attention, memory, verbal fluency, language, and visuospatial ability.\n",
      "The researchers found that:\n",
      "The researchers noted that the studies they reviewed were often not highly evaluated.\n",
      "For example, among the 25 studies that assessed a change in global cognition, there were five moderate-quality studies and 20 low-quality studies.\n",
      "“I agree with the study’s methodologies and findings. However, there were no findings about cognition in mid-life, only late life,” said Ryan Glatt, CPT, a senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in California who was not involved in the research.\n",
      "“However, the cognitive outcome measures seemed to be limited, and practice effects were not considered when evaluating the cognitive measures,” he told Medical News Today. “Many of the studies analyzed were not high quality, which may affect the findings.”\n",
      "Why a weak association is still important\n",
      "Although the researchers found that physical activity had a weak association with lowering the risk of cognitive decline, they believed that even a weak association is important.\n",
      "“This systematic review and meta-analysis seem to reinforce the belief that exercise plays a role in slowing cognitive decline. One interesting question this study seems to answer is ‘how much,’ and it is interesting to read the conclusion of ‘only to a very small extent,'” Glatt said. “This [conclusion] challenges prior biases about how much physical activity can make a difference, but there are some caveats. As the study states, ‘even a weak association is important from a population health perspective.'”\n",
      "“This study provides new information regarding how strong the association of baseline physical activity is with late-life cognition, and while physical activity will be strongly recommended and encouraged for individuals, the narrative of the magnitude of its importance may be modified,” Glatt added.\n",
      "The role of study quality\n",
      "The researchers noted that their results indicated a dose-response association between physical activity and cognition in studies that looked at binary outcomes.\n",
      "Follow-up length, follow-up rate, and physical activity measurement type and quality all played a role in determining the association.\n",
      "They further noted that they also found that study quality did not significantly moderate any of the associations. For a study to be considered high-quality, it must include more than a 10-year follow-up.\n",
      "The researchers said they do not believe any other meta-analysis examined continuous outcomes or specific cognitive domains. In addition, they had access to more than 300,000 participants’ medical records.\n",
      "The most obvious limitation is the sub-standard study quality. There was limited data examining mid-life physical activity and cognition. The scientists noted that excluding studies without valid measures of cognition at baseline might have limited their ability to detect adjustment for baseline cognition.\n",
      "The researchers indicated they did not assess whether studies accounted for practice effects when measuring cognition.\n",
      "Promoting good brain health\n",
      "“When engaging in healthy lifestyle factors for brain health, lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity and cognitive stimulation can help to increase brain blood flow, improve heart health, increase brain activity, and increase brain volumes,” Glatt said\n",
      "“Even for individuals with cognitive decline and dementia, adhering to and improving upon multiple lifestyle factors may be able to slow cognitive decline or improve behavioral outcomes such as mood or certain aspects of cognition,” he added. “However, this depends upon multiple individual, biological, and environmental factors, including the specific lifestyle changes the person follows.”\n",
      "Stopping smoking reduces cancer risk at any age, especially after 10 years, according to a new study.\n",
      "Researchers report that former smokers’ risks of developing lung cancer drop the fastest after stopping smoking.\n",
      "Quitting when you’re younger has stronger benefits in cancer risk reduction, but the benefits of quitting after age 50 are still significant, the researchers said.\n",
      "Quitting smoking at any age appears to significantly reduce a person’s risk of lung and other cancers.\n",
      "That’s the conclusion of research published today in the journal JAMA Network Open.\n",
      "For their study, researchers looked at a cohort of nearly 3 million people over the age of 30 with an average follow-up of 13 years.\n",
      "In their findings, researchers reported that those who stopped smoking entirely had a 17% lower overall risk of cancer than those who continued to smoke. That included a 42% lower risk of lung cancer incidence, a 27% lower risk of liver cancer, a 14% lower risk of stomach cancer, and a 20% lower risk of colorectal cancer.\n",
      "Of all cancers, lung cancer risks declined the most quickly following smoking cessation, falling three years earlier than other cancers. And while quitting before age 50 was better for improving your odds against a lung cancer diagnosis — averaging a 57% lower risk of lung cancer — even quitting after age 50 reduces lung cancer risk by 39% compared to continued smokers, the researchers reported.\n",
      "Reaction to the smoking and cancer risk study\n",
      "“This is a very large population-based study that demonstrates that smoking cessation reduces cancer risk at any age, particularly at a younger age. It also provides insight into the importance of smoking cessation over a longer period and how this further reduces the risk of getting cancer,” said Dr. Anton Bilchik, a surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in California.\n",
      "“The limitations include that it is a retrospective population-based study and therefore does not have detail on non-cancer related deaths and the impact of smoking cessation,” Bilchik, who was not involved in the research, told Medical News Today.\n",
      "One unusual finding was that the researchers found that cancer risk was slightly higher for 10 years post-quitting before falling to half the risk of those who continue to smoke after 15 years.\n",
      "However, this can be explained by the data researchers were working with, according to Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the Department of Public Health and Community Medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.\n",
      "“The major limitation of the study is the inclusion of ‘sick smokers’ in the study, which means people who quit specifically because they already experienced cancer symptoms. This resulted in the observation of an increased risk of cancer for the first five years after smoking, which is an anomaly,” he told Medical News Today. “The sensitivity analysis showed that there is a steady decrease in cancer risk after smoking cessation. The main finding is that quitting smoking results in a substantial decrease in cancer risk within about five years, and by 10 years, the risk almost drops to that of nonsmokers.”\n",
      "This aligns with a note from the study authors of a previous case-control study showing that past smokers who had quit for 10 years had nearly equal the liver cancer risks to those who had never smoked.\n",
      "Never too late to quit smoking\n",
      "“These findings reinforce that it is never too late to quit smoking,” Siegel said. “There is never a time when it’s too late to start trying to quit. The health benefits of quitting occur almost immediately and even the cancer risks drop substantially in just a few years.”\n",
      "Considering the health effects inclusive of, but not limited to, cancer risk is critical, experts say.\n",
      "From the first hour to the first month to the first year of stopping smoking, people experience improvements in respiratory functioning and blood circulation and see their heart attack risk cut in half, among other benefits.\n",
      "“This is the most important finding of this study,” Bilchik said. “No matter what age, don’t smoke, and if you do — stop! Also, do not assume that if you have been a long-term smoker, you have no hope. You do and this study supports it.”\n",
      "Researchers say people with obesity who had bariatric surgery had lower blood pressure, better body mass index scores, and used less medication than those who only used drugs to control hypertension\n",
      "They say their five-year study demonstrates the lasting health benefits of bariatric surgery\n",
      "Exercise, improved diet, quitting smoking, and getting better sleep also can reduce blood pressure\n",
      "Hypertension is common among people with obesity, but people who undergo bariatric surgery to control their weight are better able to lower their blood pressure than those taking antihypertensive medication alone.\n",
      "That’s according to a study published today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n",
      "Researchers reported that individuals who underwent bariatric surgery — procedures involving the digestive system designed to limit the amount of food that can be consumed at one sitting — were more likely to maintain normal blood pressure medication and had lower body mass index (BMI) scores after five years than people with obesity who did not have the surgery.\n",
      "“Bariatric surgery treats the underlying cause of high blood pressure rather than just dilating the blood vessels” like antihypertensive medications do, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, the director of bariatric surgery at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York who was not involved in the research.\n",
      "“Obesity is a symptom of metabolic overload, so if you’re not addressing that, you’re not addressing the problem,” he explained to Medical News Today.\n",
      "“In clinical practice, obesity is an overlooked condition,” said Dr. Carlos Aurelio Schiavon, the lead author of the study and a surgeon specializing in bariatric surgery at Heart Hospital and BP Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a press statement. “As a consequence, there is a frequent failure in approaching obesity as a crucial step for mitigating the risk of important cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension.”\n",
      "Details from the study on bariatric surgery and blood pressure\n",
      "The study included 100 participants, about three-quarters of whom were female.\n",
      "At the beginning of the study, the subjects had an average BMI of nearly 37Kg/m2, had high blood pressure, and were taking at least two medications.\n",
      "When assessed at five years, nearly 47% of those who underwent bariatric surgery had controlled their blood pressure without medications, compared to 2% of those who only received medical therapy.\n",
      "BMI was 28Kg/m2 for those who received bariatric surgery and 36Kg/m2 for those on medical therapy alone. The participants who had bariatric surgery had reduced their medication use by 80% while non-surgical participants only reduced medication use by 13%.\n",
      "“Bariatric surgery has lasting effects,” said Roslin. “It has been shown to have more long-term benefits than any other surgical procedure,” including reducing cancer and cardiac mortality as well as hypertension.\n",
      "Strategies for lowering blood pressure\n",
      "In a commentary accompanying the published study, Dr. Michael Hall, a professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said further studies are needed to assess “the threshold for bariatric surgery in people with obesity, optimal timing of bariatric surgery in obese people with cardiometabolic diseases,” and the type of bariatric surgery that’s most effective.\n",
      "“[C]omparative studies of obesity pharmacotherapies and bariatric surgery are needed to clarify the optimal treatment pathways for this common and growing disease,” he added.\n",
      "“In addition to sustained weight loss having a great effect on reducing blood pressure medications, there are additional metabolic effects that result from bariatric surgery,” Dr. Mir Ali, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California who was not involved in the research, told Medical News Today. “Not all these effects are well understood and research continues to better comprehend these effects.”\n",
      "“If patients have hypertension secondary to obesity, then any way a patient can get to a healthy weight — by diet, exercise, medications, etc. — they are more likely to be able to reduce blood pressure,” Ali added. “Additionally, reducing alcohol and nicotine use, reducing salt intake, proper sleep, reducing stress and regular exercise all have beneficial effects on blood pressure.”\n",
      "“Good aerobic exercise can increase your natural nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilating agent,” Dr. Nicole Weinberg, a cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California who was not involved in the research, told Medical News Today. “This causes your blood vessels to dilate and lowers your blood pressure.”\n",
      "Salmon contains unique compounds that are associated with improved cardiometabolic health indicators, such as lower cholesterol, a new nutrimetabolomic study shows.\n",
      "The study explored the health benefits of salmon in the context of a Mediterranean diet, known for focusing on healthy oils and fats.\n",
      "As part of the study, participants ate two servings of salmon a week, for two five-week periods.\n",
      "Nutrimetabolomics is a cutting-edge means of investigating food nutrients, however, not everyone is sold on it.\n",
      "Salmon has long been considered a healthy food, especially when eaten in diets that forgo excessive salts, processed foods, and unhealthy oils. Now, a new study examines salmon from a metabolomic perspective, and describes, on a molecular level, the health benefits of salmon.\n",
      "The study found that salmon contains 508 food-specific compounds, or FSCs, including 237 metabolites that are unique to salmon.\n",
      "When it is eaten as part of a Mediterranean diet, salmon delivers to the body at least 48 of these compounds, along with 30 metabolites — substances produced during digestion or other body chemical processes. Four of these metabolites are associated with significant improvements in cardiometabolic health indicators, or CHI.\n",
      "A Mediterranean diet has an emphasis on healthy oils for fat, such as olive oil. It favors plant-based sources of nutrition, including vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Protein is supplied by sources such as poultry, fish, and vegetable proteins such as beans, as well as yogurt and cheese.\n",
      "Compared to the standard Western diet, the Mediterranean diet largely avoids red meats, sugars, excessive salt, and unhealthy fats.\n",
      "For the new study, researchers performed a secondary analysis of an existing random controlled feeding trial involving 41 participants who ate a Mediterranean diet for two five-week periods, with a four-week break in between. Individuals ate two servings of salmon per week during the diet intervention periods.\n",
      "Participants were recruited in the Greater Lafayette, IN area, and none were already eating a Mediterranean diet. Their ages ranged from 30 to 69. They had obesity or overweight, although none had any active metabolic conditions — such as type 2 diabetes — or acute illnesses.\n",
      "The researchers recorded their CHIs, and collected the participants’ blood plasma samples before and after the study.\n",
      "The researchers used chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to analyze participants’ plasma, as well as salmon and 99 other foods consumed on a Mediterranean diet. If the researchers found a compound in all instances of salmon but not in other diet foods, they characterized it as a salmon FSC.\n",
      "They then identified metabolites associated with the salmon FSCs via machine learning.\n",
      "The researchers found increases in two annotated salmon FSCs and two metabolites were associated with greater cardiometabolic health, evident by CHIs in the participants’ blood plasma at the end of the trial. These cardiometabolic benefits included reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B, which is an indicator of heart disease.\n",
      "The study is published in The Journal of Nutrition.\n",
      "What is nutrimetabolomics?\n",
      "Michelle Routhenstein, cardiology dietician and preventive cardiology nutritionist at EntirelyNourished.com, who was not involved in the study, said the study and its “findings suggest that this approach could help find important compounds in foods that might be helpful for health. But more research is needed to confirm this.”\n",
      "“Metabolomic studies have highlighted the diverse array of bioactive compounds present in olive oil, such as phenolic compounds and oleic acid, which are associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardiovascular health benefits,” she explained.\n",
      "The same sort of research, said Routhenstein, has found barley, quinoa, and bulgur to be rich sources of phytochemicals. These include phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans, and phytosterols, compounds possessing antioxidant properties that help to combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.\n",
      "Hyper-focusing on good vs. bad food may be harmful\n",
      "Conner Middelmann, a nutritionist specializing in the Mediterranean diet who was likewise not involved in the study, expressed some doubts, however, saying, “research that reduces food to infinitesimally tiny molecules that may or may not have some sort of effect on health isn’t highly relevant to my work.”\n",
      "For her patients, Middelmann continued: “I’m just wondering: will the metabolites of a particular food have the same effect on a wide range of people with different biochemistries and histories? If not, how relevant is this sort of research to people’s day-to-day lives?”\n",
      "Middelmann cited, among other things, variations in people’s individual biochemistry, genetics, age, sex, medical conditions, and treatments, as well as psycho-socioeconomic and environmental factors that affect biochemistry.\n",
      "“If anything, I try to help my clients move away from this hyper-granular approach to food as medicine where they obsess about getting compound ‘X’ from one food and avoiding compound ‘Y’ from another,” she said.\n",
      "“[H]ealth is about so much more than food, and the idea that if we eat ‘perfectly, we’ll be perfectly healthy’ is an illusion,” said Middelmann.\n",
      "Middelmann noted that several of her clients are now recovering from hyper-focusing on ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ foods.\n",
      "Other fish that are as good as salmon\n",
      "The investigation of salmon in a Mediterranean diet demonstrates the flexibility of the diet, since salmon are native to the coasts of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, far from the Mediterranean Sea. They are, however, grown in aquaculture in other locations.\n",
      "Routhenstein suggested the reason that the non-Mediterranean fish nonetheless qualified as a sensible candidate for the study.\n",
      "“The diet includes a variety of other fish that have a similar nutritional profile and are associated with numerous health benefits. For instance, sardines and trout are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, which are beneficial for heart health. They are also a good source of protein, vitamin D, and calcium,” she noted.\n",
      "To Middelmann, who specializes in the Mediterranean diet, it “is about joyfully eating lots of different types of fish and seafood, but also a wide variety of everything else — veggies, legumes, whole grains, fruits, nuts, seeds, olives, eggs, yogurt, cheese, etc. — because it tastes good, makes you feel good, and is nutritious.”\n",
      "“I know that doesn’t sound very scientific, but it seems to work pretty well for the folks living in the Mediterranean region,” she added.\n",

      "The first topic we delved into was that of the link between artificial sweeteners and cancer. This particular piece of research found that a chemical in a commonly used artificial sweetener may cause DNA damage.\n",
      "The chemical in question was sucralose-6-acetate, a metabolite of the sweetener sucralose. The study findings showed that sucralose harms gut health and may lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, and hence increase the risk of cancer.\n",
      "Dr. Hilary Guite, our presenter, pointed out the most common food items that contain this sweetener: “It’s in chewing gum, salad dressings, barbecue sauces, sugar-free jams…”\n",
      "One important nuance here was that this study was done on human blood cells. To see the same DNA-damaging effect in humans, an average human weighing 70 kilograms would have to consume 18 liters of sucralose-sweetened beverages daily.\n",
      "Andrea then asked: “Why [is] there such little research about the cancer-causing effects of artificial sweeteners in humans when we are aware that there are so many potential health risks involved with consuming too much sugar in general?”\n",
      "Although it is a difficult question to answer, there are many obstacles — including funding, timing, and ethical challenges in conducting such long-term studies in humans.\n",
      "Why are colon cancer rates rising in young people?\n",
      "Our next topic was colon cancer and how worried we should be about the near doubling of cases in recent years. The study identified four key symptoms linked to an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer in younger adults. The symptoms included abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and iron deficiency anemia.\n",
      "Andrea started off with a statistic: “[W]e’re seeing this huge increase in [the proportion of] colon and rectal cancer incidence in people under 55. It’s doubled over the past 20 years from 11% to 20%.”\n",
      "She pointed out that early onset cancer is defined as being diagnosed under the age of 50 and current recommendations for colorectal cancer screenings start at around age 45.\n",
      "Maria drew attention the specific symptoms the study listed:\n",
      "“[Out of this list of symptoms], diarrhea is not uncommon. Iron deficiency anemia is not uncommon. And what was emphasized in the study was that having just one of these symptoms could almost double your risk of colon cancer, which to me was shocking. My question is the question that everybody’s asking: Why is this happening?”\n",
      "A multitude of factors can explain the rise of colon cancer rates.\n",
      "“[I]t may be attributed to just being a byproduct of how we live and work. [M]ost of us engaged in any type of knowledge work where you’re sitting all day, there’s going to be health consequences. So lifestyle factors play a role, diet plays a role. Of course, a person’s health history, and even family history of colon cancer can also play a role,” said Andrea.\n",
      "Why is there no male birth control pill on the market yet?\n",
      "Our final topic was contraception and more specifically, birth control options for men. This feature on the male birth control pill questioned why there were no oral contraceptives for men on the market despite equivalents for females being in use since the 1960s.\n",
      "Maria broached the subject by listing the current two options available for men: condoms and vasectomies.\n",
      "She said that although condoms are the most common barrier method of contraception, they may not be suitable for everyone as the materials, spermicides, or lubricants used within them may cause allergies, and also there is the possibility of the condom breaking. As for vasectomies, reversal may have a 95% success rate of return of sperm, but pregnancy after a vasectomy reversal is still only 30-70%.\n",
      "Meanwhile, I had one question on my mind regarding the lack of oral contraceptives:\n",
      "“[A] lot of these trials were stopped by the researchers or the funders after they saw that men had a lot of side effects. One of them, for example, was mood disorders like depression. So, my question is, we have something on the market already that causes such side effects, but we’re subjecting millions of women to take these, why can’t men do that? [W]hat do you think is the main reason behind this?”\n",
      "In the feature, Prof. Lonny Levin told Medical News Today that female hormonal birth control continues on the market “just because society has come to accept it” by now, but “the side effect bar for a healthy person to take a drug is really high, and it should be.”\n",
      "“I would bet that we have the technology and resources to create a male oral contraceptive that is safe with minimal side effects. I mean, if we can manufacture and prove the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in a short timeframe, certainly, we have the ability, from a science perspective to create this contraceptive,” said Andrea.\n",
      "What should we do in order to live healthier lives for longer? Research shows there are a few lifestyle interventions that can effectively prolong our life and health span. One of these is exercise, but what kind, and in what combinations, and why does it help add years to our lives? Find out in our latest podcast episode.\n",
      "Seemingly since times immemorial, humankind has been, metaphorically speaking, seeking the path that leads to the “Fountain of Youth” — that is ways to ensure a longer, healthier life.\n",
      "And while we may not yet benefit of any “miracle” medicines or technologies to prolong our life spans well over the hundred-year mark, many recent studies have provided strong evidence in support of the notion that simple, achievable lifestyle changes can help us stay healthy for longer and decrease our risk of premature death.\n",
      "Research presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2023, for example, suggested that eight healthy habits can slow down biological aging by as much as 6 years.\n",
      "These habits are related to diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, maintaining good sleep hygiene, managing cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure, and, no less importantly, staying physically active.\n",
      "In the latest instalment of our In Conversation podcast, Medical News Today explores the link between exercise and living a long and healthy life, in dialogue with Dr. Borja del Pozo Cruz and Dr. Edwina (Eddie) Brocklesby.\n",
      "Dr. del Pozo Cruz is principal researcher in Applied Health Sciences at the University of Cadiz in Spain, and adjunct associate professor in the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics at the University of Southern Denmark.\n",
      "In collaboration with other researchers, Dr. del Pozo Cruz has conducted various studies exploring the link between different forms of exercise and the risk of death from different causes.\n",
      "Dr. Brocklesby has gained fame under the nickname “Iron Gran,” as at the age of 72, she was the oldest British woman to complete an Ironman Triathlon. She is also founder and CEO of Silverfit, a not-for-profit organization promoting lifelong fitness.\n",
      "What types of exercise lower death risk?\n",
      "In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in August 2023, Dr. del Pozo Cruz and his colleagues analyzed data from 500,705 participants followed up for a median period of 10 years to see how different forms of exercise related to a person’s mortality risk.\n",
      "The study looked at the effect of moderate aerobic physical activity, such as walking or gentle cycling, vigorous aerobic physical activity, such as running, and muscle-strengthening activity, like weight lifting.\n",
      "Its findings indicated that a balanced combination of all of these forms of exercise worked best for reducing mortality risk.\n",
      "More specifically, around 75 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, plus more than 150 minutes of vigorous exercise, alongside at least a couple of strength training sessions per week were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.\n",
      "When it came to reducing the risk of death linked to cardiovascular disease specifically, Dr. del Pozo Cruz and his collaborators suggested combining a minimum of 150–225 minutes of moderate physical activity with around 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, and two or more strength training sessions per week.\n",
      "Dr. Brocklesby, who goes by “Eddie,” is herself an example of the importance of combining different forms of exercise. Indeed, training and participating in a triathlon — which is an endurance multisport race where participants compete in swimming, cycling, and running — involves achieving a balanced “diet” of moderate and vigorous exercise, as well as strength training.\n",
      "How little exercise is enough?\n",
      "But what about people who are not nearly as athletic? What is the minimum “amount” of exercise that could help fend off some of the conditions that pose the highest threat to health?\n",
      "Dr. del Pozo Cruz and his team may also have found an answer to this question. In December 2022, they published the findings to a previous study in the European Heart Journal.\n",
      "This research suggested that engaging in vigorous exercise for only 2 minutes a day could help slash the risk of death related to cancer or cardiovascular events.\n",
      "The researchers found that study participants who never engaged in vigorous exercise had a 4% risk of dying within 5 years, but introducing less than 10 minutes of vigorous activity weekly halved this risk. Moreover, their risk of death halved again for those who engaged in at least 60 minutes of exercise per week.\n",
      "Is any physical activity good?\n",
      "In our podcast, Dr. del Pozo Cruz emphasized that almost any amount of any form of exercise is better than none, a point reinforced by a new study arguing that any activity at all is better for heart health than a sedentary lifestyle.\n",
      "However, he also cautioned that physical activity related to chores or to one’s job, as opposed to exercise in a leisure context, may sometimes do more harm than good.\n",
      "Once again, his idea is supported by recently published research, which found a link between physically demanding occupations and a higher risk of cognitive impairment.\n",
      "Some of the most common occupations linked to intensive physical activity cited in this research were in nursing and care, retail, and farming, where individuals are on their feet a lot, and often having to deal with stressful situations.\n",
      "So while all forms of exercise can be good for health, strenuous or intensive physical activity in a work environment could end up compounding the risk of various health conditions.\n",
      "And even exercise for leisure can affect aspects of physical health — such as joint integrity — particularly later in life. In our podcast, both Dr. del Pozo Cruz and Eddie emphasized the importance of consulting a trusted healthcare provider, who can advise on the best forms of exercise to engage in on an individual basis.\n",

      "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of people, often severely impacting their day-to-day lives. What role does the gut microbiome play in IBD, and can we harness dietary interventions to manage symptoms? Medical News Today explores this question In Conversation with a researcher and an expert through lived experience.\n",
      "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella-term that encompasses ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, two chronic gastrointestinal conditions characterized by inflammation of the gut.\n",
      "Some of the symptoms of IBD include nausea and vomiting, blood in stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and irregularities in the menstrual cycle — all of these are invisible issues that can severely impact a person’s quality of life on a daily basis.\n",
      "IBD affects many people all over the world. In the United States, for example, around 1% of all adults have diagnosed IBD — and while that may seem like a small percentage overall, it actually amounts to approximately 2 million people.\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, the most recent estimates suggest that IBD affects around 0.8% of the population, or around 131,000 people.\n",
      "And that figure may be a serious underestimate of the real prevalence of IBD, as both Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis have symptoms that can also be attributed to other chronic conditions, which often makes them difficult to diagnose.\n",
      "Research from the U.K. published in the Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis in 2020 suggested that an individual could see their doctor in relation to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms for 5 years before they receive the correct diagnosis of IBD.\n",
      "A different gut microbiome\n",
      "Yet recent research shows that in people with IBD, the gut microbiome — the community of bacteria and other microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract — has certain particularities that set it apart from the microbiomes of healthy individuals, and which may offer clues to better treatments.\n",
      "In this episode of our In Conversation podcast, we speak to Dr. Marcel de Zoete, an associate professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology at UMC Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n",
      "In January 2023, Dr. de Zoete and his colleagues published a paper in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, showing that people with IBD had two previously unidentified bacterial species in their intestinal tracts — a new species of Allobaculum mucilyticum, and a new species of Allobaculum fili. This finding may offer important clues about the underlying mechanisms in IBD, as well as potential new treatments.\n",
      "Can diet help manage symptoms?\n",
      "Joining us in conversation was also Zosia Krajewska, who lives with ulcerative colitis, and received her diagnosis at the age of 14.\n",
      "Zosia told us about how changing her diet and lifestyle — alongside medical treatments — has helped her manage her ulcerative colitis and feel healthier, overall.\n",
      "Past research has suggested that, in some people, dietary fiber and high-sugar diets can worsen the symptoms of IBD, while favoring ultra-processed foods can increase the risk of Crohn’s disease.\n",
      "Conversely, a recent study showed that following a healthy diet and having a healthy lifestyle may help reduce a person’s risk of IBD.\n",
      "Future research avenues for treatments\n",
      "Beyond lifestyle interventions, however, it is also important for researchers to find better ways of fighting the underlying mechanisms of IBD.\n",
      "One promising avenue is research looking at gut immune cells, which play an important role in inflammation and other processes in the gut. Harnessing immune cell activity in the gut may, in the future, help treat different forms of IBD.\n",
      "Another potential treatment line that has been receiving attention from researchers, but which is currently only rarely used in clinical settings, is fecal microbiota transplantation. This presupposes the transfer of “good bacteria” into the guts of people with gastrointestinal disorders.\n",

      "What makes us change? Why is it so difficult to change our minds about things? And what is it that makes us take action and change our behavior? Medical News Today tries to answer these questions while sharing three podcasts that inspired concrete changes in their lives.\n",
      "It’s not often that something we read, listen to, or see has a real lasting impact on our behavior. In fact, sparking such a fundamental change in habits—owing to the nature of the way the human brain operates—is a lot more complex than thought.\n",
      "According to behavioral change models, getting a human to purposefully change their habits or behavior requires the following driving forces:\n",
      "So, not only do we need the inspiration to change our minds or behavior, but we also need the motivation and renewed commitment to turn it into action and stick with it.\n",
      "On that note, this month, Dr. Hilary Guite, Medical News Today’s Features Editor Maria Cohut, and Global News Editor Yasemin Nicola Sakay sat down to discuss the impact previous In Conversation podcast episodes had on them— specifically, the ones that got them to change their behavior, leading them to adopt new habits in their daily lives.\n",
      "If you’d like to hear snippets from our daily lives and listen to our discussion on how these episodes helped spark changes in our lives and how we embraced change, listen to our podcast on your preferred streaming platform down below:\n",
      "Changing our minds\n",
      "Dr. Guite chose January 2022’s blood donation special episode, for which we collaborated with the American Red Cross to encourage more people to donate blood and plasma products amid a winter marred by a blood shortage crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. For Dr. Guite, the episode and the frank discussions we had helped her get over that initial fear of donating blood and prompted her to become a donor again after a 20–30-year break.\n",
      "She said the blood donor and the recipient talking about the “gift of life” was especially inspirational, and what Dr. Baia Lasky, medical director of the American Red Cross, said next really chimed in with her life values:\n",
      "“Because it’s something that is universal. [W]e are connecting people in a way that most donors never meet the patients and most patients never meet their donors. And I think it’s a really powerful testimony to how we are connected and how interdependent we are on one another, and in a very palpable way.”\n",
      "Acting on our intentions\n",
      "For Maria, the standout podcast was January 2023’s podcast on diet and mental health, which was one of the episodes that were a part of our nutrition-dedicated series.\n",
      "She said after hearing about the connection between inflammation and foods and how they can impact neurotransmitters and chemicals in the brain and affect mood, she decided to try a few tips for herself to see if she’d see any changes.\n",
      "One piece of advice that stuck with Maria was the importance of variety in one’s diet.\n",
      "“So, go to the supermarket and if you always buy one kind of bean, buy six kinds of beans. If you always buy one kind of flour, buy six kinds of flour. If you always buy one kind of oil to cook with buy six kinds of oil. I mean, flax oil is a good one for omega-3s— [especially] if you don’t like oily fish, which not everybody would like,” she recalled Rachel Kelly, a U.K.-based mental health campaigner who has been outspoken about how diet helped treat her own depression, saying on that episode.\n",
      "Our discussion spanned from comfort foods to disordered eating before inevitably touching on the Mediterranean diet and its many benefits— not only for mental health but also for the heart and the brain.\n",
      "We also talked about “happy foods” such as green leafy vegetables, oily fish, and dark chocolate. Maria shared that she had incorporated more fish into her diet and her favorite hojicha, Japanese green tea. (Also, the episode contains an impromptu recipe for a Mediterranean-inspired mung bean salad.)\n",
      "Changing how we feel\n",
      "For me, there were many contenders, but perhaps the first one that came to mind was September 2022’s podcast on chronic pain. In that episode, we delved into the science behind how pain becomes chronic and addressed what it means when we say “pain is the brain.” We also shared with our listeners our own experiences— led by Joel Nelson, a longtime psoriatic disease and arthritis patient and advocate, who shared his personal journey with pain.\n",
      "One of the quotes that stood out to me in that episode was by Dr. Tony L. Yaksh, professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology at the University of California, San Diego:\n",
      "“[W]e started out this conversation by saying pain is in the brain. So when I say pain is in the brain, I am not saying it’s any less real, in any way, shape, or form. It’s a real thing. [W]e now teach medical students that just because you don’t see the primary diagnosis as being a swollen joint doesn’t mean the patient doesn’t have something. [T]he intent is to actually validate and bring into reality, the kinds of issues that occur when you discover that stress and so forth has changed this pain condition. [M]indfulness in a way can help the individual.”\n",
      "Not long after this podcast, I enrolled in a genetics-based nutrition and mindfulness program that helped me shift my views about pain and chronic inflammation, leading me to tweak my ways of managing pain. The biggest takeaway for me from that episode was that the key to managing and treating pain was lowering stress levels and inflammation and building up mental resilience. In this episode, I shared some of the steps I took to achieve that— which included a different approach to using painkillers.\n",
      "How to change our habits\n",
      "One of the biggest takeaways from our discussion was that change does not happen overnight. The key is to take small steps that can be slowly integrated into one’s daily life.\n",
      "Another point was the importance of showing yourself grace and being more self-compassionate when trying to turn these behavioral changes into habits.\n",
      "Letting such changes fit into one’s values instead of going against them and adopting a positive attitude to alter thinking were other points that seem crucial in making a change stick. For more, we’d encourage you to tune in to the podcast.\n"

So, my question is, we have something on the market already that causes such side effects, but we’re subjecting millions of women to take these, why can’t men do that? [W]hat do you think is the main reason behind this?”',\n",

       " 'What should we do in order to live healthier lives for longer? Research shows there are a few lifestyle interventions that can effectively prolong our life and health span. One of these is exercise, but what kind, and in what combinations, and why does it help add years to our lives? Find out in our latest podcast episode.',\n",
       " 'Seemingly since times immemorial, humankind has been, metaphorically speaking, seeking the path that leads to the “Fountain of Youth” — that is ways to ensure a longer, healthier life.',\n",
       " 'And while we may not yet benefit of any “miracle” medicines or technologies to prolong our life spans well over the hundred-year mark, many recent studies have provided strong evidence in support of the notion that simple, achievable lifestyle changes can help us stay healthy for longer and decrease our risk of premature death.',\n",
       " 'Research presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2023, for example, suggested that eight healthy habits can slow down biological aging by as much as 6 years.',\n",
       " 'These habits are related to diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, maintaining good sleep hygiene, managing cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure, and, no less importantly, staying physically active.',\n",
       " 'In the latest instalment of our In Conversation podcast, Medical News Today explores the link between exercise and living a long and healthy life, in dialogue with Dr. Borja del Pozo Cruz and Dr. Edwina (Eddie) Brocklesby.',\n",
       " 'Dr. del Pozo Cruz is principal researcher in Applied Health Sciences at the University of Cadiz in Spain, and adjunct associate professor in the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics at the University of Southern Denmark.',\n",
       " 'In collaboration with other researchers, Dr. del Pozo Cruz has conducted various studies exploring the link between different forms of exercise and the risk of death from different causes.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Brocklesby has gained fame under the nickname “Iron Gran,” as at the age of 72, she was the oldest British woman to complete an Ironman Triathlon. She is also founder and CEO of Silverfit, a not-for-profit organization promoting lifelong fitness.',\n",
       " 'What types of exercise lower death risk?',\n",
       " 'In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in August 2023, Dr. del Pozo Cruz and his colleagues analyzed data from 500,705 participants followed up for a median period of 10 years to see how different forms of exercise related to a person’s mortality risk.',\n",
       " 'The study looked at the effect of moderate aerobic physical activity, such as walking or gentle cycling, vigorous aerobic physical activity, such as running, and muscle-strengthening activity, like weight lifting.',\n",
       " 'Its findings indicated that a balanced combination of all of these forms of exercise worked best for reducing mortality risk.',\n",
       " 'More specifically, around 75 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, plus more than 150 minutes of vigorous exercise, alongside at least a couple of strength training sessions per week were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.',\n",
       " 'When it came to reducing the risk of death linked to cardiovascular disease specifically, Dr. del Pozo Cruz and his collaborators suggested combining a minimum of 150–225 minutes of moderate physical activity with around 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, and two or more strength training sessions per week.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Brocklesby, who goes by “Eddie,” is herself an example of the importance of combining different forms of exercise. Indeed, training and participating in a triathlon — which is an endurance multisport race where participants compete in swimming, cycling, and running — involves achieving a balanced “diet” of moderate and vigorous exercise, as well as strength training.',\n",
       " 'How little exercise is enough?',\n",
       " 'But what about people who are not nearly as athletic? What is the minimum “amount” of exercise that could help fend off some of the conditions that pose the highest threat to health?',\n",
       " 'Dr. del Pozo Cruz and his team may also have found an answer to this question. In December 2022, they published the findings to a previous study in the European Heart Journal.',\n",
       " 'This research suggested that engaging in vigorous exercise for only 2 minutes a day could help slash the risk of death related to cancer or cardiovascular events.',\n",
       " 'The researchers found that study participants who never engaged in vigorous exercise had a 4% risk of dying within 5 years, but introducing less than 10 minutes of vigorous activity weekly halved this risk. Moreover, their risk of death halved again for those who engaged in at least 60 minutes of exercise per week.',\n",
       " 'Is any physical activity good?',\n",
       " 'In our podcast, Dr. del Pozo Cruz emphasized that almost any amount of any form of exercise is better than none, a point reinforced by a new study arguing that any activity at all is better for heart health than a sedentary lifestyle.',\n",
       " 'However, he also cautioned that physical activity related to chores or to one’s job, as opposed to exercise in a leisure context, may sometimes do more harm than good.',\n",
       " 'Once again, his idea is supported by recently published research, which found a link between physically demanding occupations and a higher risk of cognitive impairment.',\n",
       " 'Some of the most common occupations linked to intensive physical activity cited in this research were in nursing and care, retail, and farming, where individuals are on their feet a lot, and often having to deal with stressful situations.',\n",
       " 'So while all forms of exercise can be good for health, strenuous or intensive physical activity in a work environment could end up compounding the risk of various health conditions.',\n",
       " 'And even exercise for leisure can affect aspects of physical health — such as joint integrity — particularly later in life. In our podcast, both Dr. del Pozo Cruz and Eddie emphasized the importance of consulting a trusted healthcare provider, who can advise on the best forms of exercise to engage in on an individual basis.',\n",

What role does the gut microbiome play in IBD, and can we harness dietary interventions to manage symptoms? Medical News Today explores this question In Conversation with a researcher and an expert through lived experience.',\n",
       " 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella-term that encompasses ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, two chronic gastrointestinal conditions characterized by inflammation of the gut.',\n",
       " 'Some of the symptoms of IBD include nausea and vomiting, blood in stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and irregularities in the menstrual cycle — all of these are invisible issues that can severely impact a person’s quality of life on a daily basis.',\n",
       " 'IBD affects many people all over the world. In the United States, for example, around 1% of all adults have diagnosed IBD — and while that may seem like a small percentage overall, it actually amounts to approximately 2 million people.',\n",
       " 'In the United Kingdom, the most recent estimates suggest that IBD affects around 0.8% of the population, or around 131,000 people.',\n",
       " 'And that figure may be a serious underestimate of the real prevalence of IBD, as both Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis have symptoms that can also be attributed to other chronic conditions, which often makes them difficult to diagnose.',\n",
       " 'Research from the U.K. published in the Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis in 2020 suggested that an individual could see their doctor in relation to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms for 5 years before they receive the correct diagnosis of IBD.',\n",
       " 'A different gut microbiome',\n",
       " 'Yet recent research shows that in people with IBD, the gut microbiome — the community of bacteria and other microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract — has certain particularities that set it apart from the microbiomes of healthy individuals, and which may offer clues to better treatments.',\n",
       " 'In this episode of our In Conversation podcast, we speak to Dr. Marcel de Zoete, an associate professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology at UMC Utrecht, The Netherlands.',\n",
       " 'In January 2023, Dr. de Zoete and his colleagues published a paper in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, showing that people with IBD had two previously unidentified bacterial species in their intestinal tracts — a new species of Allobaculum mucilyticum, and a new species of Allobaculum fili. This finding may offer important clues about the underlying mechanisms in IBD, as well as potential new treatments.',\n",

       " 'Joining us in conversation was also Zosia Krajewska, who lives with ulcerative colitis, and received her diagnosis at the age of 14.',\n",
       " 'Zosia told us about how changing her diet and lifestyle — alongside medical treatments — has helped her manage her ulcerative colitis and feel healthier, overall.',\n",
       " 'Past research has suggested that, in some people, dietary fiber and high-sugar diets can worsen the symptoms of IBD, while favoring ultra-processed foods can increase the risk of Crohn’s disease.',\n",
       " 'Conversely, a recent study showed that following a healthy diet and having a healthy lifestyle may help reduce a person’s risk of IBD.',\n",
       " 'Future research avenues for treatments',\n",
       " 'Beyond lifestyle interventions, however, it is also important for researchers to find better ways of fighting the underlying mechanisms of IBD.',\n",
       " 'One promising avenue is research looking at gut immune cells, which play an important role in inflammation and other processes in the gut. Harnessing immune cell activity in the gut may, in the future, help treat different forms of IBD.',\n",
       " 'Another potential treatment line that has been receiving attention from researchers, but which is currently only rarely used in clinical settings, is fecal microbiota transplantation.

For Dr. Guite, the episode and the frank discussions we had helped her get over that initial fear of donating blood and prompted her to become a donor again after a 20–30-year break.',\n",

If you always buy one kind of oil to cook with buy six kinds of oil. I mean, flax oil is a good one for omega-3s— [especially] if you don’t like oily fish, which not everybody would like,” she recalled Rachel Kelly, a U.K.-based mental health campaigner who has been outspoken about how diet helped treat her own depression, saying on that episode.',\n",

       " 'Changing how we feel',\n",
       " 'For me, there were many contenders, but perhaps the first one that came to mind was September 2022’s podcast on chronic pain. In that episode, we delved into the science behind how pain becomes chronic and addressed what it means when we say “pain is the brain.” We also shared with our listeners our own experiences— led by Joel Nelson, a longtime psoriatic disease and arthritis patient and advocate, who shared his personal journey with pain.',\n",
       " 'One of the quotes that stood out to me in that episode was by Dr. Tony L. Yaksh, professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology at the University of California, San Diego:',\n",
       " '“[W]e started out this conversation by saying pain is in the brain. So when I say pain is in the brain, I am not saying it’s any less real, in any way, shape, or form. It’s a real thing. [W]e now teach medical students that just because you don’t see the primary diagnosis as being a swollen joint doesn’t mean the patient doesn’t have something. [T]he intent is to actually validate and bring into reality, the kinds of issues that occur when you discover that stress and so forth has changed this pain condition. [M]indfulness in a way can help the individual.”',\n",
       " 'Not long after this podcast, I enrolled in a genetics-based nutrition and mindfulness program that helped me shift my views about pain and chronic inflammation, leading me to tweak my ways of managing pain. The biggest takeaway for me from that episode was that the key to managing and treating pain was lowering stress levels and inflammation and building up mental resilience. In this episode, I shared some of the steps I took to achieve that— which included a different approach to using painkillers.',\n",
