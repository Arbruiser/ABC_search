One 30-minute session of moderate walking can lower the systolic blood pressure of women with rheumatoid arthritis, according to a new study.
Many people with rheumatoid arthritis also experience high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular issues.
The authors of the study believe the effect of these exercise sessions can result in a permanent lowering of systolic blood pressure.
The study observed no similar reduction in diastolic blood pressure.
Thirty minutes of moderate physical activity can lower systolic blood pressure in women who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at rest, under stress, and generally, according to a new study from the University of São Paulo, Brazil.
Hypertension is of particular risk for people with RA, whose risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is 48% higher than that of the general population.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease. With RA, one’s immune system incorrectly attacks healthy cells. The result is inflammation — along with painful swelling – often in multiple synovial joints at the same time.
Most commonly, RA affects joints in the knees, hands, and wrists. RA can damage the tissue in these joints, causing prolonged or chronic pain, balance issues, and deformity. It can also cause problems in the eyes, heart, and lungs, as well as other parts of the body.
The condition is frequently accompanied by hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
The direct cause of RA is currently unknown, although known risk factors include:
The study is published in the Journal of Human Hypertension.
Lower blood pressure with exercise
The study was a randomized controlled crossover trial that observed the effects of a single session of aerobic exercise on resting blood pressure, stress-related blood pressure, and a full day’s blood pressure in people with both RA and high blood pressure.
Participants in the study were all women since RA impacts them two to three times more often than men.
The trial’s 20 participants walked at moderate speeds on a treadmill for 30 minutes or served as a control group, resting.
Before and after each woman’s exercise session, the researchers measured resting blood pressure. In order to look at blood pressure in response to stress, blood pressure was also measured in response to the Stroop-Color Word Test and the Cold Pressor test.
The Stroop-Color Word Test is a cognitive challenge in which individuals are presented the names of colors printed in other hues. They are asked to recite the words’ actual color rather than the word its letters spell.
The Cold Pressor Test is a pain-tolerance test in which individuals place their hands in cold water — 4° C — to produce slight or moderate pain for as long as they keep their hand submerged.
Without exercise, it is expected that an individual’s systolic and diastolic blood pressure will rise by 18 mmHG and 11 mmHG, respectively, in response to the Cold Pressor Test. However, on days in which participants engaged in exercise, their systolic blood pressure actually decreased by 1 mmHG in response to the test.
After exercise, each individual was outfitted with an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for measuring hypertension over the following 24 hours.
The exercise group exhibited lowered resting systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mHG, and stressed blood pressure by 7 mmHG. Twenty-four-hour systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5 mmHG.
This is a meaningful decrease in blood pressure since reductions of 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure have been linked to clinical reductions in the risk of dying due to stroke (-14%), coronary artery disease (-9%), and all causes (-7%) for people with hypertension.
The researchers observed no effect on diastolic blood pressure resulting from the exercise.
Systolic blood pressure reflects the pressure in arteries as the heart beats. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in arteries while the heart is at rest. When one has a blood pressure test, it is usually shown as one number over the other — systolic pressure is the one on top.
How exercise helps lower blood pressure
The study’s senior investigator, Dr. Tiago Peçanha explained that “aerobic exercise reduces systolic blood pressure by promoting a relaxation of the blood vessels. We call this “vasodilation.”
Significantly, he added, “This can happen after a single session of aerobic exercise and prolong to several hours after the end of exercise, said Dr. Peçanha.
“We call this post-exercise hypotension, and this phenomenon may benefit people with high blood pressure,” he said.
Dr. Peçanha suggested that every time a person exercises, the temporary improvements in blood pressure may become more permanent and more prominent.
“It is like the effects of a medication that may improve your symptoms in the short term, but that will bring even better results over time with regular use,” said Dr. Peçanha.
Cardiologist Dr. Jayne Morgan, who was not involved in the study, agreed, saying, “Small decreases in blood pressure in response to acute exercise can accumulate over time when done repeatedly, and provide a more sustained decrease or decay in hypertension. And this is independent of the RA population.”
Considering varying results from other studies, Dr. Peçanha proposed 30 minutes may be the optimal exercise time for this purpose.
How rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension are linked
The high concurrence of RA and hypertension, said Dr. Morgan, “is thought to be due to the drugs used to treat the [RA] disease process, such as NSAIDS and steroids.
She added that RA patients tend to have less elasticity in their blood vessels, which can also cause blood pressure to rise, as well as generalized inflammation, including vasculitis, and inflammation of blood vessels.
“Moreover,” said Dr. Morgan, “those with chronic joint pain, whether it is caused by RA or some other factor, can often have high blood pressure because of the combination of both pain and inflammation, which can, in turn, raise cortisol levels in response to stress.”
Does exercise have the same effect on men with RA?
Asked whether the same results would be observed in male study participants, Dr. Peçanha said, “we don’t know really if that would also happen in men with rheumatoid arthritis. We assume that the effects of exercise are similar between women and men, but that is not always the case.”
He noted that while women get RA far more often than men, “there is data showing that although men are less affected by rheumatoid arthritis, the risk of future cardiovascular events is higher in men compared to women with RA.”
Therefore,” he said, “there is a need to investigate interventions that may benefit men with rheumatoid arthritis, and exercise could be a very effective approach.”

How much should you exercise for a longer, healthier life? Study offers clues
There are many factors when it comes to living a long and healthy life.
Some of these factors cannot be changed, while many others are modifiable.
A new study from researchers at the University of Jyväskylä has found that while exercise is important to living a long life, following other healthy lifestyle habits may have an even greater impact.
Many factors are involved when it comes to living a long and healthy life.
Some factors like genetics and gender cannot be changed. However, many other habits, such as nutrition, physical activity, reducing stress, not smoking, and proper sleep, can be modified.
A new study from researchers at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland that is currently being peer-reviewed has found that while exercise is important to living a long life, following other healthy lifestyle habits may have an even greater impact.
Longevity: Exercise may not be a factor on its own
Ms. Anna Kankaanpää, project researcher at the Gerontology Research Center in the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland and lead author of this study, told Medical News Today she decided to study the correlation between leisure-time physical activity and mortality risk because a previous study conducted at the University of Jyväskylä suggested that the association may be due to genetic influences.
“This finding contradicts results from a study involving Swedish twins, which found an association independent of genetic factors,” Kankaanpää continued. “I aimed to explore the reason for this discrepancy.”
Also, in the study, the researchers discuss that while previous research shows a link between exercise and a lower risk of mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease, some previous research — such as this study published in December 2021 — found exercise does not reduce all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular disease in older adults or people with chronic conditions.
This, the researchers say, may show there are other underlying factors than exercise alone affecting how long a person lives.
Physically active lifestyle linked to lower mortality risk
For this study, the research team used the data of more than 11,000 sets of adult twins from the Finnish Twin Cohort.
The amount of physical activity study participants had was assessed through questionnaires given in 1975, 1981, and 1990. Participants were placed into four groups: sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active. And participants’ mortality was monitored until 2020, a span of 45 years.
At the end of the study, Kankaanpää and her team found that over a third — almost 40% — of participants from the sedentary group died by the mortality follow-up in 2020, which was the largest percentage of the four groups.
Participants in the active groups had between 15% and 23% lower all-cause mortality risk when compared to the sedentary group.
“I was not surprised (by these results) because numerous observational studies consistently indicate this association,” Kankaanpää commented.
How do other lifestyle factors affect mortality risk?
The researchers then factored in other lifestyle factors, including body mass index (BMI), health status, alcohol use, and smoking status.
When those factors were applied, the mortality rate of participants from the sedentary group dropped to a maximum of 7%.
The scientists also found that participants in the sedentary and highly active groups experienced accelerated biological aging when compared to the moderately active and active groups.
According to the study, the researchers believe the beneficial association of long-term exercise with reduced death risk was largely accounted for not only by exercise but also by other health-related factors.
Instead of regular physical activity being the cause of lower mortality risk, it may instead be an indicator of an overall healthy lifestyle, helping to extend a person’s life.
“It would be interesting to study whether the same holds for cause-specific mortality, such as mortality due to cardiovascular diseases,” Kankaanpää said when asked about the next steps in this research. “Moreover, I would like to investigate the reasons behind the accelerated biological aging observed in highly active participants.”
One healthy habit does not counteract unhealthy lifestyle
After reviewing this study, Dr. David Cutler, a board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT that this study’s conclusion that the health benefits of being physically active may reflect healthy behavior in general, rather than exercise being the cause of reduced mortality, makes sense.
“(It) is consistent with my own observation that while many people exercise to gain health benefits, they often expect it to counteract unhealthful behaviors, which it does not,” Dr. Cutler explained. “This notion of ‘compensatory belief’ was supported by findings in the study.”
“Compensatory belief is the common notion that if you do something healthful it can counteract something unhealthful,” he continued. “For example, if you exercise it will eliminate the adverse effects of smoking. And in fact, what the study found was that the mortality in the sedentary group improved if you eliminated factors such as obesity and smoking.”
Dr. Cutler also said it is important to remember that engaging in healthful physical activity does not offset unhealthful diet, smoking, alcohol and drug use, or other detrimental activities like ignoring high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.
“Significant improvements in health have been found worldwide through five simple measures: avoiding obesity, keeping blood pressure normal, not smoking, controlling diabetes, and treating high cholesterol,” he added. “Regular exercise might add to those benefits, but it won’t offset the detrimental effects of ignoring those proven beneficial pursuits.”
Some exercise is better than none for healthier, longer life
MNT also spoke about this study with Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute, Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study.
Dr. Chen said this study clearly shows that being able to perform some exercise is associated with decreased mortality compared to just being sedentary and that some exercise is better than none.
“There have been other studies in the last few years that showed that there is kind of a leveling off (of) the benefits (of exercise),” he explained. “A study on the number of steps people take every day. These studies have shown that after a certain amount of walking — around 7,000 or 8000 steps a day — the benefit levels off. So it’s not like if you walk 20,000 steps a day, you’re better off if you walk 7,000 steps a day.”
“(This study) corresponds with other (recent) studies that showed at least a moderate amount of exercise is helpful,” Dr. Chen added. “That it might not be necessary to have a very high degree of exercise to get the health benefits should be the message.”
Dr. Chen also commented that one of the limitations is that this research was done on a very set population of Finland, which is not necessarily the same as people in the United States.
“It would be nice to look at data on a more heterogeneous population in the United States,” he added.

Why binge drinking is more dangerous for your liver than daily alcohol consumption
Researchers say
binge drinking combined with genetic risk can dramatically raise the risk of developing alcohol-related cirrhosis
They add that having type 2 diabetes puts people who binge drink at even greater risk
Experts say the study findings could help identify people who need targeted interventions to prevent liver disease
Alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver is often thought of as a disease related to chronic alcohol misuse, but new research is reporting that this deadly liver illness may also be triggered by binge drinking.
Researchers said that people who binge drink and also have a genetic makeup putting them at higher risk of alcohol-related cirrhosis may have a six-fold increased risk of developing the disease compared to study participants who reported drinking within daily limits and had low genetic predisposition to alcohol-related cirrhosis.
The researchers noted that this risk was even higher among binge drinkers who also had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Their findings were detailed in a study published in the journal Nature Communications.
In cases where all three risk factors are present — binge drinking, genetic disposition, and the presence of type 2 diabetes — drinking patterns may play a more significant role in development of cirrhosis than the volume of drinking, according to the researchers from University College London, the Royal Free Hospital, the University of Oxford, and the University of Cambridge.
“Many studies that look into the relationship between liver disease and alcohol focus on the volume of alcohol consumed,” said Linda Ng Fat, a first study author and a senior research fellow at the University College London, in a press statement. “We took a different approach by focusing on the pattern of drinking and found that this was a better indicator of liver disease risk than volume alone. The other key finding was that the more risk factors involved, the higher the ‘excess risk’ due to the interaction of these factors.”
“This research is important because it reveals that it’s not just how much you drink overall but the way that you drink matters,” added Pamela Healy, chief executive officer of the British Liver Trust. “Drinking a lot, quickly, or drinking to get drunk, can have serious consequences for your liver health.”
Researchers said the each factor raised the risk of liver disease even when viewed in isolation.
For example, those who engaged in heavy binge drinking, categorized as having 12 units of alcohol in a day at some point during a given week, were three times as likely to develop alcohol-related cirrhosis.
The risk for those with a high genetic predisposition was four times higher and the risk for those with type 2 diabetics was two times higher.
How binge drinking damages the liver
Dr. Theodore Strange, the chair of the department of medicine at Staten Island University Hospital in New York who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today that the research makes an interesting distinction between the health risks of binge drinking as opposed to the sheer quantity of alcohol consumed.
“This needs to be studied more as there may be something that genetically predisposes some people to have more serious liver injuries from binge drinking that may be due to just the shock of that amount of alcohol to be processed so quickly as opposed to more sustained amounts over time,” he said.
Strange said the “shock of binging could possibly overwhelm the liver’s ability to metabolize alcohol” and may “acutely affect the ability of the cells of the liver to survive because of acute damage, which they may be genetically prone to.”
“Binge drinking puts immense strain on the liver, which is responsible for metabolizing alcohol,” Adam Zagha, the founder of Numa Recovery Centers and a certified mental health and addiction treatment who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “When alcohol is consumed in excessive amounts, the liver is unable to keep up with the detoxification process, leading to the accumulation of toxins and the development of liver cirrhosis over time.”
What to know about binge drinking and liver disease
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as episodes where blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is raised to 0.08% or more.
For men, that usually means consuming five or more drinks within two hours. For women, the same BAC is typically reached by consuming four or more drinks in the same time period.
Researchers said that liver disease is among the leading causes of premature death globally with an estimated 2% to 3% of the world’s population having cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver disease.
“It is crucial for individuals with a family history of liver disease or those with a genetic predisposition to alcoholism to be aware of the increased risk they face,” said Zagha. “This knowledge can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption and seek help before irreversible liver damage occurs.”
Dr. Steven Bell, a senior author of the study and a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge, noted in the press statement that liver disease, and particularly alcohol-related fatalities, has surged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This study equips us with novel tools that are essential in pinpointing individuals at highest risk, thereby enabling us to direct interventions more effectively toward those who stand to benefit the most,” he said.

Managing chronic inflammation with psoriasis
Avoiding inflammatory foods:
Considering an anti-inflammatory diet:
Avoiding or quitting smoking:
Reducing alcohol intake:
Staying active:
Getting enough sleep:
Managing stress levels:
Although the exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, doctors consider it an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. This means that inflammation is at the root of this condition.
Up to 3% of adults in the United States have psoriasis. It causes skin symptoms, such as raised plaques and discoloration, and can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints and eyes.
Experts believe inflammation is the common factor that can affect these different areas.
What causes inflammation in psoriasis?
In people with psoriasis, immune system dysfunction causes inflammatory cells to build up in the middle layer of the skin, known as the dermis. The condition also speeds the growth of skin cells in the epidermis, the outer skin layer.
Typically, skin cells grow and flake off in the span of a month. This process speeds up to just a few days in people with psoriasis. Instead of shedding, skin cells pile up on the skin’s surface, leading to uncomfortable symptoms such as raised plaques, scales, swelling, and redness or discoloration.
Even though psoriasis is a skin condition, the inflammation associated with psoriasis affects the entire body. It can increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriatic arthritis.
Is there a way to treat inflammation?
Although inflammation in psoriasis is due to immune system dysregulation, studies suggest that people can reduce this inflammation through lifestyle and dietary changes. This can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.
Using these methods, many people who have psoriasis can maintain remission, which is a long period without experiencing psoriasis symptoms.
Additionally, certain medications to treat psoriasis work by reducing inflammation. These include topical corticosteroids, injectable biologics, and oral medications.
Everyone with psoriasis is different. Some people will require more extensive treatment than others.
How to manage inflammation
While there is currently no cure for psoriasis, the following habits may help reduce psoriasis-related inflammation and increase a person’s chances of experiencing remission.
Diet is strongly linked to systemic inflammation. Studies suggest that certain inflammatory dietary patterns can increase the risk of psoriasis and worsen symptoms.
A nutritious diet looks different for everyone. However, the following steps may help a person establish one:
Obesity is a risk factor for psoriasis development. People with psoriasis who have overweight or obesity may also experience more severe symptoms than people with a moderate weight.
Weight loss may reduce inflammatory markers and help reduce psoriasis symptoms in people with excess body weight.
A 2020 study found that people with psoriasis and overweight or obesity who reduced their body weight by 12% through a 10-week program experienced a 50–75% reduction in psoriasis severity. Participants experienced an average weight loss of 23 pounds.
Several habits can help reduce inflammation and improve psoriasis symptoms, such as:
When to seek medical help
Anyone experiencing a psoriasis flare who is interested in learning ways to reduce psoriasis symptoms and inflammation may wish to consider speaking with their healthcare team, including their dermatologist.
They can recommend treatment methods based on symptom severity and provide recommendations for diet and lifestyle changes that may help lower inflammation and reduce psoriasis symptoms. They may also suggest taking vitamins or supplements.

Blood test may detect early signs of Alzheimer's in the brain, study suggests
Alzheimer’s disease is a clinical diagnosis, and there is, as of yet, no single, simple diagnostic test.
The diagnostic tests that exist can be invasive, expensive, and time-consuming.
Developing a simple, early diagnostic test could help to target the use of new Alzheimer’s drugs to people in the early stages of the condition.
An international team has found a blood test that detects a particular form of tau is effective at detecting changes in amyloid and tau in the brain.
A blood test that screens for Alzheimer’s disease shows promise in detecting changes in amyloid beta and tau protein levels in the brain years before symptoms emerge, according to a new study published in JAMA Neurology.
Despite Alzheimer’s disease affecting more than 55 million people worldwide, there is still no reliable and simple way to diagnose the condition.
This has led to a situation in the United States where less than half of people with dementia have been diagnosed by a physician, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Doctors normally make a diagnosis by taking a history of symptoms and excluding the possibility of other types of dementia, such as vascular dementia, using scans, or cerebrospinal fluid tests. These are all time-consuming, expensive, and potentially invasive.
Lack of accuracy in testing means detecting the disease in its early stages is difficult. A result of this is that the few treatment options that are available for Alzheimer’s disease can’t be started early when they might be the most effective, and it is also hard to design trials to determine if certain drugs would be effective if started in the early stages of the disease.
Why early detection of Alzheimer’s disease is crucial
In 2023, controversy reigned over the FDA’s decision to approve aducanumab and lecanemab, due to a lack of evidence for their efficacy. One of the limitations of the trials of these drugs had been the inability to start their use earlier in the progression of the disease, potentially affecting results, it was argued at the time.
Early diagnosis could reduce healthcare costs overall as, even if it were not possible to treat Alzheimer’s disease, it would help to manage other chronic conditions and reduce hospitalizations better. The CDC estimates up to $64,000 could be saved per person with dementia, with early diagnosis.
Dr. David Hunter, an assistant professor of neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, told Medical News Today in an email that more tools to detect Alzheimer’s disease would be welcomed:
“As Alzheimer’s specialists, we very much want a blood test that confirms the diagnosis. This has become urgent in the last year, as there is now an FDA-approved drug for Alzheimer’s that we call a Disease Modifying Therapy (DMT). At the moment, we rely on either a PET scan or a Lumbar Puncture. Both are expensive and somewhat invasive tests.”
Can an Alzheimer’s blood test help early diagnosis?
The hunt has been on for a simple blood test or saliva test that could determine whether or not somebody has the characteristic buildup of amyloid beta and tau in the brain. One of the challenges posed by developing a blood test is that the blood-brain barrier limits the amount of substances present in the brain from reaching the bloodstream. Plus, tau and amyloid proteins are, by their nature, sticky.
There has been significant research into determining the form of tau found in the blood that is the most likely to indicate raised levels of tau and amyloid in the brain, and not elsewhere in the body. Previous research has looked at the ratio of certain forms of amyloid beta compared to other forms, and p-tau217 has also emerged as a form of tau that is indicative of the development of amyloid and tau buildup in the brain.
In 2023, a blood test for detecting amyloid beta protein was developed and made available by a company called AD-Detect. They also created the ALZpath pTau217 assay, which is only available to researchers but allows them to detect this form of tau in a blood test.
This was made available, free of charge, to an international group of researchers based across Scandinavia, Europe, and the United States to determine how this assay compared to using cerebrospinal fluid to biomarkers used to detect Alzheimer’s disease.
Detecting amyloid beta, tau proteins in the brain
Researchers looked at data from three sources — a cohort of individuals at risk of Alzheimer’s disease — and the other two were biobanks set up to investigate neurodegenerative conditions or aging and dementia. There were a total of 786 participants with a mean age of 66, including 504 female and 282 male participants.
Analysis of data showed that the assay was able to identify individuals in which there were abnormal levels of amyloid beta and tau but did not look at whether or not this correlated with the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers tested the assay in conjunction with imaging data.
They found that the assay provided more accurate detection of hippocampal atrophy and was similar in its ability to detect abnormal levels of amyloid beta and tau as cerebrospinal fluid tests. This was the case across the three groups.
The authors said that the assay could detect abnormal levels of amyloid beta and tau in 80% of tested participants and that the remaining 20% would need confirmatory imaging or cerebrospinal fluid tests. They claimed this was more accurate than current diagnostic tools and could be used to identify people for early intervention with emerging pharmaceutical treatments designed to reduce amyloid buildup.
The makers of the assay reviewed the manuscript before it was submitted to the journal.
Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s remains challenging
Dr. Clifford Segil, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the research, told MNT that a blood test was not necessarily the answer for early detection. Dr. Segil said: “The authors noted there is no clear relationship to serum tau protein levels and cognitive complaints and therefore has no clinical utility for a neurologist or any physician to evaluate a patient with memory loss in 2024.”
“I strongly disagree, as a clinical neurologist who diagnoses and treats patients with cognitive complaints and memory loss, that blood biomarkers have any role in the clinical evaluation of patients with memory loss and dementia and would agree these may have a role in pharmaceutical drug trial enrollment as proposed by this paper.
[T]he goal to reduce Alzheimer’s diagnoses on advanced confirmatory tests is a pharmaceutical company goal and not a neurologist’s goal.”
– Dr. Segil
He warned there were risks with the approach proposed:
“If biomarkers are used millions of people will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease who may have no memory loss or cognitive impairment. A blood test for tau has no place to be used in a primary care physician’s office or a neurologist’s office in the clinical evaluation of patients with memory loss or cognitive impairment being evaluated for Alzheimer’s dementia. It will diagnose patients with Alzheimer’s dementia who are without memory loss and may never have memory loss.”

Semen microbiome linked to male infertility, study finds
Semen has its own microbiome, and bacterial imbalances may impact sperm count and quality, according to a new study.
The researchers found unusually high levels of the bacteria Lactobacillus iners in males with low sperm motility.
The link between the health of the semen microbiome and gut microbiome remains unclear.
Experts say healthy lifestyle choices that promote a healthy gut could also support the health of the semen microbiome.
Globally, there is a reported decrease in male sperm count or the number of viable sperm within semen.
Some research points toward pollution as a factor contributing to male infertility, but this does not explain why an estimated 30% of semen is considered abnormal.
A new reproductive study of semen examined the impact of the health of the semen microbiome on sperm motility, which is the sperm’s ability to swim successfully through the female reproductive system to reach and potentially fertilize an ovum or egg.
The study finds that high levels of the bacteria Lactobacillus iners (L. iners) are associated with low sperm motility.
This study represents the first time a distinct semen microbiome has been suggested and investigated, and the first in which L. iners has been linked to a lowering of sperm motility.
The study is published in Scientific Reports.
Balance of bacteria in semen microbiome affects sperm health
Along with “sperm helpers,” such as enzymes, fructose, and citric acid, there is a community of bacteria within semen.
In addition to L. iners, the most prominent bacteria found in semen include:
For the study, the semen of 73 males seeking treatment for reproduction issues or vasectomies was analyzed.
The researchers found that 27 males with reproduction issues all exhibited higher amounts of L. iners compared to the 46 males seeking vasectomies who had already successfully reproduced and who had healthy semen.
The males with abnormal semen also had comparatively higher levels of the bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas fluorescens. They had lower levels of Pseudomonas putida than those with normal semen.
How does bacteria impact human infertility?
The study’s first author, Dr. Vadim Osadchiy, an academic urologist specializing in men’s health and infertility, explained how the L. iners bacteria present in males and females may affect infertility:
In females, “this microbe can act as a symbiotic organism, meaning it helps maintain the healthy vaginal microbiome and prevents bad players from taking over,” Dr. Osadchiy said.
However, some studies suggest that, at times, the bacteria may “predispose a person to developing bacterial vaginosis or even sexually transmitted infections,” he added.
Dr. Osadchiy noted the L. iners bacteria may also impact success rates for people undergoing fertility treatments.
“There is some data suggesting worse assisted reproductive technology outcomes when this microbe is found in higher abundance in the vaginal microbiome,” he said.
“This microbe has never really been studied within the context of male factor fertility, or really within the context of men’s health.”
Is there a link between the semen microbiome and gut microbiome?
The relationship, if any, between the lesser-known semen microbiome and the gut microbiome is unclear, but experts have a few theories.
“I think the farther away you get from the reproductive tract, anatomically speaking, the more tenuous the relationship becomes between the semen microbiome and the various other microbiomes in our bodies,” Dr. Osadchiy suggested.
“We know there is an intimate relationship between the urinary and semen microbiome as the reproductive and urinary tract are interconnected [although] the two microbiomes are certainly distinct,” Dr. Osadchiy added.
Dr. Menka Gupta, a functional medicine doctor with NutraNourish, not involved in the study, suggested it may be possible to improve semen microbiome health but prioritizing gut health.
“I can potentially see a connection between the gut and the semen microbiome through lifestyle factors such as diet, level of stress, [and] exposure to toxins,” Dr. Gupta said.
Dr. Osadchiy noted it may be possible that a gut microbiome with inflammation could “result in conditions that favor a pro-inflammatory semen microbiome.”
“I’m not sure if there is too much definitive data on this yet, but that would be my hunch,” he said.
More research on the semen microbiome needed
Dr. Gupta said further exploration of the role of the semen microbiome in fertility outcomes is needed, which could lead to “new treatments to improve sperm parameters and male fertility.”
Dr. Osadchiy agreed, noting there’s still much to learn about the body’s microbiomes in general, specifically the semen microbiome.
“We know that microbial community interactions can be just as important as the actions of individual players, so work to understand microbial communities in semen would help contextualize our findings. There are still so many questions related to the semen microbiome. More exploratory work but larger sample sizes and greater geographic diversity may help us better characterize what is expected variability since it’s likely there isn’t just one ‘good’ semen microbiome and not just one ‘bad’ microbiome.”
— Dr. Vadim Osadchiy, first study author
Dr. Osadchiy said a deeper understanding of the relationship between the semen microbiome and infertility is also needed, and researchers currently lack “a good sense of what sort of factors are under our control to positively (or negatively) impact the semen microbiome.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if what is good for the body in general is also good for the semen microbiome,” Dr. Osadchiy added.
Despite the lack of understanding of the relationship between the semen and gut microbiome, both Dr. Osadchiy and Dr. Gupta recommended prioritizing healthy lifestyle choices to improve sperm quality and motility. These include:
Dr. Gupta also noted the value of abstaining from alcohol and smoking and following a diet rich in antioxidants and probiotic foods.
