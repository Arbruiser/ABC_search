https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/rheumatoid-arthritis-30-minute-aerobic-exercise-help-lower-systolic-blood-pressure
One 30-minute session of moderate walking can lower the systolic blood pressure of women with rheumatoid arthritis, according to a new study.
Many people with rheumatoid arthritis also experience high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular issues.
The authors of the study believe the effect of these exercise sessions can result in a permanent lowering of systolic blood pressure.
The study observed no similar reduction in diastolic blood pressure.
Thirty minutes of moderate physical activity can lower systolic blood pressure in women who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at rest, under stress, and generally, according to a new study from the University of São Paulo, Brazil.
Hypertension is of particular risk for people with RA, whose risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is 48% higher than that of the general population.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease. With RA, one’s immune system incorrectly attacks healthy cells. The result is inflammation — along with painful swelling – often in multiple synovial joints at the same time.
Most commonly, RA affects joints in the knees, hands, and wrists. RA can damage the tissue in these joints, causing prolonged or chronic pain, balance issues, and deformity. It can also cause problems in the eyes, heart, and lungs, as well as other parts of the body.
The condition is frequently accompanied by hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
The direct cause of RA is currently unknown, although known risk factors include:
The study is published in the Journal of Human Hypertension.
Lower blood pressure with exercise
The study was a randomized controlled crossover trial that observed the effects of a single session of aerobic exercise on resting blood pressure, stress-related blood pressure, and a full day’s blood pressure in people with both RA and high blood pressure.
Participants in the study were all women since RA impacts them two to three times more often than men.
The trial’s 20 participants walked at moderate speeds on a treadmill for 30 minutes or served as a control group, resting.
Before and after each woman’s exercise session, the researchers measured resting blood pressure. In order to look at blood pressure in response to stress, blood pressure was also measured in response to the Stroop-Color Word Test and the Cold Pressor test.
The Stroop-Color Word Test is a cognitive challenge in which individuals are presented the names of colors printed in other hues. They are asked to recite the words’ actual color rather than the word its letters spell.
The Cold Pressor Test is a pain-tolerance test in which individuals place their hands in cold water — 4° C — to produce slight or moderate pain for as long as they keep their hand submerged.
Without exercise, it is expected that an individual’s systolic and diastolic blood pressure will rise by 18 mmHG and 11 mmHG, respectively, in response to the Cold Pressor Test. However, on days in which participants engaged in exercise, their systolic blood pressure actually decreased by 1 mmHG in response to the test.
After exercise, each individual was outfitted with an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for measuring hypertension over the following 24 hours.
The exercise group exhibited lowered resting systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mHG, and stressed blood pressure by 7 mmHG. Twenty-four-hour systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5 mmHG.
This is a meaningful decrease in blood pressure since reductions of 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure have been linked to clinical reductions in the risk of dying due to stroke (-14%), coronary artery disease (-9%), and all causes (-7%) for people with hypertension.
The researchers observed no effect on diastolic blood pressure resulting from the exercise.
Systolic blood pressure reflects the pressure in arteries as the heart beats. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in arteries while the heart is at rest. When one has a blood pressure test, it is usually shown as one number over the other — systolic pressure is the one on top.
How exercise helps lower blood pressure
The study’s senior investigator, Dr. Tiago Peçanha explained that “aerobic exercise reduces systolic blood pressure by promoting a relaxation of the blood vessels. We call this “vasodilation.”
Significantly, he added, “This can happen after a single session of aerobic exercise and prolong to several hours after the end of exercise, said Dr. Peçanha.
“We call this post-exercise hypotension, and this phenomenon may benefit people with high blood pressure,” he said.
Dr. Peçanha suggested that every time a person exercises, the temporary improvements in blood pressure may become more permanent and more prominent.
“It is like the effects of a medication that may improve your symptoms in the short term, but that will bring even better results over time with regular use,” said Dr. Peçanha.
Cardiologist Dr. Jayne Morgan, who was not involved in the study, agreed, saying, “Small decreases in blood pressure in response to acute exercise can accumulate over time when done repeatedly, and provide a more sustained decrease or decay in hypertension. And this is independent of the RA population.”
Considering varying results from other studies, Dr. Peçanha proposed 30 minutes may be the optimal exercise time for this purpose.
How rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension are linked
The high concurrence of RA and hypertension, said Dr. Morgan, “is thought to be due to the drugs used to treat the [RA] disease process, such as NSAIDS and steroids.
She added that RA patients tend to have less elasticity in their blood vessels, which can also cause blood pressure to rise, as well as generalized inflammation, including vasculitis, and inflammation of blood vessels.
“Moreover,” said Dr. Morgan, “those with chronic joint pain, whether it is caused by RA or some other factor, can often have high blood pressure because of the combination of both pain and inflammation, which can, in turn, raise cortisol levels in response to stress.”
Does exercise have the same effect on men with RA?
Asked whether the same results would be observed in male study participants, Dr. Peçanha said, “we don’t know really if that would also happen in men with rheumatoid arthritis. We assume that the effects of exercise are similar between women and men, but that is not always the case.”
He noted that while women get RA far more often than men, “there is data showing that although men are less affected by rheumatoid arthritis, the risk of future cardiovascular events is higher in men compared to women with RA.”
Therefore,” he said, “there is a need to investigate interventions that may benefit men with rheumatoid arthritis, and exercise could be a very effective approach.”

How much should you exercise for a longer, healthier life? Study offers clues
There are many factors when it comes to living a long and healthy life.
Some of these factors cannot be changed, while many others are modifiable.
A new study from researchers at the University of Jyväskylä has found that while exercise is important to living a long life, following other healthy lifestyle habits may have an even greater impact.
Many factors are involved when it comes to living a long and healthy life.
Some factors like genetics and gender cannot be changed. However, many other habits, such as nutrition, physical activity, reducing stress, not smoking, and proper sleep, can be modified.
A new study from researchers at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland that is currently being peer-reviewed has found that while exercise is important to living a long life, following other healthy lifestyle habits may have an even greater impact.
Longevity: Exercise may not be a factor on its own
Ms. Anna Kankaanpää, project researcher at the Gerontology Research Center in the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland and lead author of this study, told Medical News Today she decided to study the correlation between leisure-time physical activity and mortality risk because a previous study conducted at the University of Jyväskylä suggested that the association may be due to genetic influences.
“This finding contradicts results from a study involving Swedish twins, which found an association independent of genetic factors,” Kankaanpää continued. “I aimed to explore the reason for this discrepancy.”
Also, in the study, the researchers discuss that while previous research shows a link between exercise and a lower risk of mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease, some previous research — such as this study published in December 2021 — found exercise does not reduce all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular disease in older adults or people with chronic conditions.
This, the researchers say, may show there are other underlying factors than exercise alone affecting how long a person lives.
Physically active lifestyle linked to lower mortality risk
For this study, the research team used the data of more than 11,000 sets of adult twins from the Finnish Twin Cohort.
The amount of physical activity study participants had was assessed through questionnaires given in 1975, 1981, and 1990. Participants were placed into four groups: sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active. And participants’ mortality was monitored until 2020, a span of 45 years.
At the end of the study, Kankaanpää and her team found that over a third — almost 40% — of participants from the sedentary group died by the mortality follow-up in 2020, which was the largest percentage of the four groups.
Participants in the active groups had between 15% and 23% lower all-cause mortality risk when compared to the sedentary group.
“I was not surprised (by these results) because numerous observational studies consistently indicate this association,” Kankaanpää commented.
How do other lifestyle factors affect mortality risk?
The researchers then factored in other lifestyle factors, including body mass index (BMI), health status, alcohol use, and smoking status.
When those factors were applied, the mortality rate of participants from the sedentary group dropped to a maximum of 7%.
The scientists also found that participants in the sedentary and highly active groups experienced accelerated biological aging when compared to the moderately active and active groups.
According to the study, the researchers believe the beneficial association of long-term exercise with reduced death risk was largely accounted for not only by exercise but also by other health-related factors.
Instead of regular physical activity being the cause of lower mortality risk, it may instead be an indicator of an overall healthy lifestyle, helping to extend a person’s life.
“It would be interesting to study whether the same holds for cause-specific mortality, such as mortality due to cardiovascular diseases,” Kankaanpää said when asked about the next steps in this research. “Moreover, I would like to investigate the reasons behind the accelerated biological aging observed in highly active participants.”
One healthy habit does not counteract unhealthy lifestyle
After reviewing this study, Dr. David Cutler, a board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT that this study’s conclusion that the health benefits of being physically active may reflect healthy behavior in general, rather than exercise being the cause of reduced mortality, makes sense.
“(It) is consistent with my own observation that while many people exercise to gain health benefits, they often expect it to counteract unhealthful behaviors, which it does not,” Dr. Cutler explained. “This notion of ‘compensatory belief’ was supported by findings in the study.”
“Compensatory belief is the common notion that if you do something healthful it can counteract something unhealthful,” he continued. “For example, if you exercise it will eliminate the adverse effects of smoking. And in fact, what the study found was that the mortality in the sedentary group improved if you eliminated factors such as obesity and smoking.”
Dr. Cutler also said it is important to remember that engaging in healthful physical activity does not offset unhealthful diet, smoking, alcohol and drug use, or other detrimental activities like ignoring high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.
“Significant improvements in health have been found worldwide through five simple measures: avoiding obesity, keeping blood pressure normal, not smoking, controlling diabetes, and treating high cholesterol,” he added. “Regular exercise might add to those benefits, but it won’t offset the detrimental effects of ignoring those proven beneficial pursuits.”
Some exercise is better than none for healthier, longer life
MNT also spoke about this study with Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute, Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study.
Dr. Chen said this study clearly shows that being able to perform some exercise is associated with decreased mortality compared to just being sedentary and that some exercise is better than none.
“There have been other studies in the last few years that showed that there is kind of a leveling off (of) the benefits (of exercise),” he explained. “A study on the number of steps people take every day. These studies have shown that after a certain amount of walking — around 7,000 or 8000 steps a day — the benefit levels off. So it’s not like if you walk 20,000 steps a day, you’re better off if you walk 7,000 steps a day.”
“(This study) corresponds with other (recent) studies that showed at least a moderate amount of exercise is helpful,” Dr. Chen added. “That it might not be necessary to have a very high degree of exercise to get the health benefits should be the message.”
Dr. Chen also commented that one of the limitations is that this research was done on a very set population of Finland, which is not necessarily the same as people in the United States.
“It would be nice to look at data on a more heterogeneous population in the United States,” he added.

Why binge drinking is more dangerous for your liver than daily alcohol consumption
Researchers say binge drinking combined with genetic risk can dramatically raise the risk of developing alcohol-related cirrhosis.
They add that having type 2 diabetes puts people who binge drink at even greater risk.
Experts say the study findings could help identify people who need targeted interventions to prevent liver disease.
Alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver is often thought of as a disease related to chronic alcohol misuse, but new research is reporting that this deadly liver illness may also be triggered by binge drinking.
Researchers said that people who binge drink and also have a genetic makeup putting them at higher risk of alcohol-related cirrhosis may have a six-fold increased risk of developing the disease compared to study participants who reported drinking within daily limits and had low genetic predisposition to alcohol-related cirrhosis.
The researchers noted that this risk was even higher among binge drinkers who also had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Their findings were detailed in a study published in the journal Nature Communications.
In cases where all three risk factors are present — binge drinking, genetic disposition, and the presence of type 2 diabetes — drinking patterns may play a more significant role in development of cirrhosis than the volume of drinking, according to the researchers from University College London, the Royal Free Hospital, the University of Oxford, and the University of Cambridge.
“Many studies that look into the relationship between liver disease and alcohol focus on the volume of alcohol consumed,” said Linda Ng Fat, a first study author and a senior research fellow at the University College London, in a press statement. “We took a different approach by focusing on the pattern of drinking and found that this was a better indicator of liver disease risk than volume alone. The other key finding was that the more risk factors involved, the higher the ‘excess risk’ due to the interaction of these factors.”
“This research is important because it reveals that it’s not just how much you drink overall but the way that you drink matters,” added Pamela Healy, chief executive officer of the British Liver Trust. “Drinking a lot, quickly, or drinking to get drunk, can have serious consequences for your liver health.”
Researchers said the each factor raised the risk of liver disease even when viewed in isolation.
For example, those who engaged in heavy binge drinking, categorized as having 12 units of alcohol in a day at some point during a given week, were three times as likely to develop alcohol-related cirrhosis.
The risk for those with a high genetic predisposition was four times higher and the risk for those with type 2 diabetics was two times higher.
How binge drinking damages the liver
Dr. Theodore Strange, the chair of the department of medicine at Staten Island University Hospital in New York who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today that the research makes an interesting distinction between the health risks of binge drinking as opposed to the sheer quantity of alcohol consumed.
“This needs to be studied more as there may be something that genetically predisposes some people to have more serious liver injuries from binge drinking that may be due to just the shock of that amount of alcohol to be processed so quickly as opposed to more sustained amounts over time,” he said.
Strange said the “shock of binging could possibly overwhelm the liver’s ability to metabolize alcohol” and may “acutely affect the ability of the cells of the liver to survive because of acute damage, which they may be genetically prone to.”
“Binge drinking puts immense strain on the liver, which is responsible for metabolizing alcohol,” Adam Zagha, the founder of Numa Recovery Centers and a certified mental health and addiction treatment who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “When alcohol is consumed in excessive amounts, the liver is unable to keep up with the detoxification process, leading to the accumulation of toxins and the development of liver cirrhosis over time.”
What to know about binge drinking and liver disease
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as episodes where blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is raised to 0.08% or more.
For men, that usually means consuming five or more drinks within two hours. For women, the same BAC is typically reached by consuming four or more drinks in the same time period.
Researchers said that liver disease is among the leading causes of premature death globally with an estimated 2% to 3% of the world’s population having cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver disease.
“It is crucial for individuals with a family history of liver disease or those with a genetic predisposition to alcoholism to be aware of the increased risk they face,” said Zagha. “This knowledge can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption and seek help before irreversible liver damage occurs.”
Dr. Steven Bell, a senior author of the study and a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge, noted in the press statement that liver disease, and particularly alcohol-related fatalities, has surged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This study equips us with novel tools that are essential in pinpointing individuals at highest risk, thereby enabling us to direct interventions more effectively toward those who stand to benefit the most,” he said.

Managing chronic inflammation with psoriasis
Avoiding inflammatory foods:
Considering an anti-inflammatory diet:
Avoiding or quitting smoking:
Reducing alcohol intake:
Staying active:
Getting enough sleep:
Managing stress levels:
Although the exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, doctors consider it an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. This means that inflammation is at the root of this condition.
Up to 3% of adults in the United States have psoriasis. It causes skin symptoms, such as raised plaques and discoloration, and can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints and eyes.
Experts believe inflammation is the common factor that can affect these different areas.
What causes inflammation in psoriasis?
In people with psoriasis, immune system dysfunction causes inflammatory cells to build up in the middle layer of the skin, known as the dermis. The condition also speeds the growth of skin cells in the epidermis, the outer skin layer.
Typically, skin cells grow and flake off in the span of a month. This process speeds up to just a few days in people with psoriasis. Instead of shedding, skin cells pile up on the skin’s surface, leading to uncomfortable symptoms such as raised plaques, scales, swelling, and redness or discoloration.
Even though psoriasis is a skin condition, the inflammation associated with psoriasis affects the entire body. It can increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriatic arthritis.
Is there a way to treat inflammation?
Although inflammation in psoriasis is due to immune system dysregulation, studies suggest that people can reduce this inflammation through lifestyle and dietary changes. This can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.
Using these methods, many people who have psoriasis can maintain remission, which is a long period without experiencing psoriasis symptoms.
Additionally, certain medications to treat psoriasis work by reducing inflammation. These include topical corticosteroids, injectable biologics, and oral medications.
Everyone with psoriasis is different. Some people will require more extensive treatment than others.
How to manage inflammation
While there is currently no cure for psoriasis, the following habits may help reduce psoriasis-related inflammation and increase a person’s chances of experiencing remission.
Diet is strongly linked to systemic inflammation. Studies suggest that certain inflammatory dietary patterns can increase the risk of psoriasis and worsen symptoms.
A nutritious diet looks different for everyone. However, the following steps may help a person establish one:
Obesity is a risk factor for psoriasis development. People with psoriasis who have overweight or obesity may also experience more severe symptoms than people with a moderate weight.
Weight loss may reduce inflammatory markers and help reduce psoriasis symptoms in people with excess body weight.
A 2020 study found that people with psoriasis and overweight or obesity who reduced their body weight by 12% through a 10-week program experienced a 50–75% reduction in psoriasis severity. Participants experienced an average weight loss of 23 pounds.
Several habits can help reduce inflammation and improve psoriasis symptoms, such as:
When to seek medical help
Anyone experiencing a psoriasis flare who is interested in learning ways to reduce psoriasis symptoms and inflammation may wish to consider speaking with their healthcare team, including their dermatologist.
They can recommend treatment methods based on symptom severity and provide recommendations for diet and lifestyle changes that may help lower inflammation and reduce psoriasis symptoms. They may also suggest taking vitamins or supplements.

Blood test may detect early signs of Alzheimer's in the brain, study suggests
Alzheimer’s disease is a clinical diagnosis, and there is, as of yet, no single, simple diagnostic test.
The diagnostic tests that exist can be invasive, expensive, and time-consuming.
Developing a simple, early diagnostic test could help to target the use of new Alzheimer’s drugs to people in the early stages of the condition.
An international team has found a blood test that detects a particular form of tau is effective at detecting changes in amyloid and tau in the brain.
A blood test that screens for Alzheimer’s disease shows promise in detecting changes in amyloid beta and tau protein levels in the brain years before symptoms emerge, according to a new study published in JAMA Neurology.
Despite Alzheimer’s disease affecting more than 55 million people worldwide, there is still no reliable and simple way to diagnose the condition.
This has led to a situation in the United States where less than half of people with dementia have been diagnosed by a physician, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Doctors normally make a diagnosis by taking a history of symptoms and excluding the possibility of other types of dementia, such as vascular dementia, using scans, or cerebrospinal fluid tests. These are all time-consuming, expensive, and potentially invasive.
Lack of accuracy in testing means detecting the disease in its early stages is difficult. A result of this is that the few treatment options that are available for Alzheimer’s disease can’t be started early when they might be the most effective, and it is also hard to design trials to determine if certain drugs would be effective if started in the early stages of the disease.
Why early detection of Alzheimer’s disease is crucial
In 2023, controversy reigned over the FDA’s decision to approve aducanumab and lecanemab, due to a lack of evidence for their efficacy. One of the limitations of the trials of these drugs had been the inability to start their use earlier in the progression of the disease, potentially affecting results, it was argued at the time.
Early diagnosis could reduce healthcare costs overall as, even if it were not possible to treat Alzheimer’s disease, it would help to manage other chronic conditions and reduce hospitalizations better. The CDC estimates up to $64,000 could be saved per person with dementia, with early diagnosis.
Dr. David Hunter, an assistant professor of neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, told Medical News Today in an email that more tools to detect Alzheimer’s disease would be welcomed:
“As Alzheimer’s specialists, we very much want a blood test that confirms the diagnosis. This has become urgent in the last year, as there is now an FDA-approved drug for Alzheimer’s that we call a Disease Modifying Therapy (DMT). At the moment, we rely on either a PET scan or a Lumbar Puncture. Both are expensive and somewhat invasive tests.”
Can an Alzheimer’s blood test help early diagnosis?
The hunt has been on for a simple blood test or saliva test that could determine whether or not somebody has the characteristic buildup of amyloid beta and tau in the brain. One of the challenges posed by developing a blood test is that the blood-brain barrier limits the amount of substances present in the brain from reaching the bloodstream. Plus, tau and amyloid proteins are, by their nature, sticky.
There has been significant research into determining the form of tau found in the blood that is the most likely to indicate raised levels of tau and amyloid in the brain, and not elsewhere in the body. Previous research has looked at the ratio of certain forms of amyloid beta compared to other forms, and p-tau217 has also emerged as a form of tau that is indicative of the development of amyloid and tau buildup in the brain.
In 2023, a blood test for detecting amyloid beta protein was developed and made available by a company called AD-Detect. They also created the ALZpath pTau217 assay, which is only available to researchers but allows them to detect this form of tau in a blood test.
This was made available, free of charge, to an international group of researchers based across Scandinavia, Europe, and the United States to determine how this assay compared to using cerebrospinal fluid to biomarkers used to detect Alzheimer’s disease.
Detecting amyloid beta, tau proteins in the brain
Researchers looked at data from three sources — a cohort of individuals at risk of Alzheimer’s disease — and the other two were biobanks set up to investigate neurodegenerative conditions or aging and dementia. There were a total of 786 participants with a mean age of 66, including 504 female and 282 male participants.
Analysis of data showed that the assay was able to identify individuals in which there were abnormal levels of amyloid beta and tau but did not look at whether or not this correlated with the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers tested the assay in conjunction with imaging data.
They found that the assay provided more accurate detection of hippocampal atrophy and was similar in its ability to detect abnormal levels of amyloid beta and tau as cerebrospinal fluid tests. This was the case across the three groups.
The authors said that the assay could detect abnormal levels of amyloid beta and tau in 80% of tested participants and that the remaining 20% would need confirmatory imaging or cerebrospinal fluid tests. They claimed this was more accurate than current diagnostic tools and could be used to identify people for early intervention with emerging pharmaceutical treatments designed to reduce amyloid buildup.
The makers of the assay reviewed the manuscript before it was submitted to the journal.
Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s remains challenging
Dr. Clifford Segil, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the research, told MNT that a blood test was not necessarily the answer for early detection. Dr. Segil said: “The authors noted there is no clear relationship to serum tau protein levels and cognitive complaints and therefore has no clinical utility for a neurologist or any physician to evaluate a patient with memory loss in 2024.”
“I strongly disagree, as a clinical neurologist who diagnoses and treats patients with cognitive complaints and memory loss, that blood biomarkers have any role in the clinical evaluation of patients with memory loss and dementia and would agree these may have a role in pharmaceutical drug trial enrollment as proposed by this paper.
[T]he goal to reduce Alzheimer’s diagnoses on advanced confirmatory tests is a pharmaceutical company goal and not a neurologist’s goal.”
– Dr. Segil
He warned there were risks with the approach proposed:
“If biomarkers are used millions of people will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease who may have no memory loss or cognitive impairment. A blood test for tau has no place to be used in a primary care physician’s office or a neurologist’s office in the clinical evaluation of patients with memory loss or cognitive impairment being evaluated for Alzheimer’s dementia. It will diagnose patients with Alzheimer’s dementia who are without memory loss and may never have memory loss.”

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/semen-microbiome-linked-to-male-infertility
Semen microbiome linked to male infertility, study finds
Semen has its own microbiome, and bacterial imbalances may impact sperm count and quality, according to a new study.
The researchers found unusually high levels of the bacteria Lactobacillus iners in males with low sperm motility.
The link between the health of the semen microbiome and gut microbiome remains unclear.
Experts say healthy lifestyle choices that promote a healthy gut could also support the health of the semen microbiome.
Globally, there is a reported decrease in male sperm count or the number of viable sperm within semen.
Some research points toward pollution as a factor contributing to male infertility, but this does not explain why an estimated 30% of semen is considered abnormal.
A new reproductive study of semen examined the impact of the health of the semen microbiome on sperm motility, which is the sperm’s ability to swim successfully through the female reproductive system to reach and potentially fertilize an ovum or egg.
The study finds that high levels of the bacteria Lactobacillus iners (L. iners) are associated with low sperm motility.
This study represents the first time a distinct semen microbiome has been suggested and investigated, and the first in which L. iners has been linked to a lowering of sperm motility.
The study is published in Scientific Reports.
Balance of bacteria in semen microbiome affects sperm health
Along with “sperm helpers,” such as enzymes, fructose, and citric acid, there is a community of bacteria within semen.
In addition to L. iners, the most prominent bacteria found in semen include:
For the study, the semen of 73 males seeking treatment for reproduction issues or vasectomies was analyzed.
The researchers found that 27 males with reproduction issues all exhibited higher amounts of L. iners compared to the 46 males seeking vasectomies who had already successfully reproduced and who had healthy semen.
The males with abnormal semen also had comparatively higher levels of the bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas fluorescens. They had lower levels of Pseudomonas putida than those with normal semen.
How does bacteria impact human infertility?
The study’s first author, Dr. Vadim Osadchiy, an academic urologist specializing in men’s health and infertility, explained how the L. iners bacteria present in males and females may affect infertility:
In females, “this microbe can act as a symbiotic organism, meaning it helps maintain the healthy vaginal microbiome and prevents bad players from taking over,” Dr. Osadchiy said.
However, some studies suggest that, at times, the bacteria may “predispose a person to developing bacterial vaginosis or even sexually transmitted infections,” he added.
Dr. Osadchiy noted the L. iners bacteria may also impact success rates for people undergoing fertility treatments.
“There is some data suggesting worse assisted reproductive technology outcomes when this microbe is found in higher abundance in the vaginal microbiome,” he said.
“This microbe has never really been studied within the context of male factor fertility, or really within the context of men’s health.”
Is there a link between the semen microbiome and gut microbiome?
The relationship, if any, between the lesser-known semen microbiome and the gut microbiome is unclear, but experts have a few theories.
“I think the farther away you get from the reproductive tract, anatomically speaking, the more tenuous the relationship becomes between the semen microbiome and the various other microbiomes in our bodies,” Dr. Osadchiy suggested.
“We know there is an intimate relationship between the urinary and semen microbiome as the reproductive and urinary tract are interconnected [although] the two microbiomes are certainly distinct,” Dr. Osadchiy added.
Dr. Menka Gupta, a functional medicine doctor with NutraNourish, not involved in the study, suggested it may be possible to improve semen microbiome health but prioritizing gut health.
“I can potentially see a connection between the gut and the semen microbiome through lifestyle factors such as diet, level of stress, [and] exposure to toxins,” Dr. Gupta said.
Dr. Osadchiy noted it may be possible that a gut microbiome with inflammation could “result in conditions that favor a pro-inflammatory semen microbiome.”
“I’m not sure if there is too much definitive data on this yet, but that would be my hunch,” he said.
More research on the semen microbiome needed
Dr. Gupta said further exploration of the role of the semen microbiome in fertility outcomes is needed, which could lead to “new treatments to improve sperm parameters and male fertility.”
Dr. Osadchiy agreed, noting there’s still much to learn about the body’s microbiomes in general, specifically the semen microbiome.
“We know that microbial community interactions can be just as important as the actions of individual players, so work to understand microbial communities in semen would help contextualize our findings. There are still so many questions related to the semen microbiome. More exploratory work but larger sample sizes and greater geographic diversity may help us better characterize what is expected variability since it’s likely there isn’t just one ‘good’ semen microbiome and not just one ‘bad’ microbiome.”
— Dr. Vadim Osadchiy, first study author
Dr. Osadchiy said a deeper understanding of the relationship between the semen microbiome and infertility is also needed, and researchers currently lack “a good sense of what sort of factors are under our control to positively (or negatively) impact the semen microbiome.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if what is good for the body in general is also good for the semen microbiome,” Dr. Osadchiy added.
Despite the lack of understanding of the relationship between the semen and gut microbiome, both Dr. Osadchiy and Dr. Gupta recommended prioritizing healthy lifestyle choices to improve sperm quality and motility. These include:
Dr. Gupta also noted the value of abstaining from alcohol and smoking and following a diet rich in antioxidants and probiotic foods.

Migraine linked to increased risk of IBD in new study
More than 1 billion people around the world have at least one migraine attack each year.
Previous research shows that migraine can potentially increase a person’s risk for several health issues, including gastrointestinal conditions.
New research from Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea says there may also be a link between migraine and an increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
More than 1 billion people globally have at least one migraine attack each year.
Previous studies show that migraine can potentially increase a person’s risk for other conditions, including stroke, heart disease, epilepsy, sleeping issues, and anxiety and depression.
Migraine has also been linked to some gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Now, researchers from Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea say there may also be a link between migraine and an increased risk for irritable bowel disease (IBD), which is an umbrella term that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
The study was recently published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Migraine and IBD: An unsurprising connection
According to Dr. Brooks D. Cash, professor and chief of the division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at UTHealth Houston in Texas, who was not involved in this study, the field of gastroenterology has recognized for many years that migraine has been associated with many chronic gastrointestinal syndromes and diseases.
“The data in this report supports previous reports of an association between migraine headaches and IBD,” Dr. Cash told Medical News Today.
Dr. Rudolph Bedford, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was also not involved in this study, told MNT that the research results were not surprising.
“[With] inflammatory bowel disease we do see some extra-intestinal manifestations including things involving the eye or ocular findings, which may be neurogenic in nature, so it wasn’t surprising,” Dr. Bedford added.
This is not the first study to look at a connection between migraine and IBD.
A study published in March 2021 of people in the United States found a higher prevalence of migraine or severe headaches among adults with IBD than in those without.
Research published in March 2023 reported an increased prevalence of IBD in people with migraine with and without aura.
Could migraine increase risk of inflammatory bowel disease?
For the current study, researchers analyzed data from more than 10 million people through the nationwide healthcare system for South Korean citizens. About 3% of the study population had IBD.
Through the data, scientists found the incidence of IBD was significantly higher in people who had migraine compared to those who did not.
Scientists also reviewed the data through subgroups of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis incidences. People with migraine in both subgroups had a higher risk of developing either condition when compared to people without migraine.
After a migraine diagnosis, researchers found people were at a higher risk of developing Crohn’s disease, with a significant rise after a 5-year follow-up.
Additionally, within the subgroups, scientists reported that the impact of migraine on the risk of developing ulcerative colitis was more prominent in men than women.
Study results not definitive
Based on these findings, the research team suggests that people with migraine be monitored carefully for the development of IBD.
However, Dr. Cash stated that the data presented do not convincingly support that approach or recommendation.
“The odds ratios that were reported in this study, which can be thought of as the increased odds of an outcome (e.g., developing IBD) with a given exposure (e.g., migraine headaches), were consistently between one to two, which is not far from definitive and can be easily misinterpreted or misrepresented,” he explained.
“The results are, at best, suggestive of an association between migraines and IBD, which we were already aware of based on previous research and deserve to be further evaluated. However, the minimal increase in the odds of developing IBD reported in this study is not sufficient to recommend increased monitoring of patients with migraines for the development of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.”

Importance of identifying potential IBD triggers
Dr. Bedford said it is important to identify potential health issues that may trigger IBD, as a doctor may be able to mitigate the symptoms of IBD if they know what may be associated with it.
“Migraines can be very debilitating and you may want to identify those people with migraines,” he continued. “We don’t normally question patients with inflammatory bowel disease whether or not they have migraine headaches, so it probably rates as something that should be done more frequently.”
“These results add to an already relatively robust body of research suggesting that chronic pain syndromes are statistically more common in patients with chronic GI syndromes or diseases,” Dr. Cash said.
“We do not have enough information or proof yet to establish a causal relationship either way. But this data can be used to explain some therapeutic approaches that may benefit both GI and neurologic symptoms in patients with migraines,” he added.
Research next steps
Regarding the next steps for this research, Dr. Cash said that mechanistic data evaluating the possible reasons for these consistent observations of association is needed.
“Right now, all we have are hypotheses,” he continued. “Are there changes in the gut-brain communication pathways or sensory perceptions in the enteric and central nervous systems? Is the gut microbiome involved? Are there psychological and stress-mediated factors at play?”
“Once clinical relationships such as these have been identified, we need to move toward trying to explain why those relationships may exist,” Dr. Cash added. “That, in turn, may lead us to develop more targeted and effective therapies that can address multiple symptoms/syndromes.”
Dr. Bedford suggested researchers look for an association between IBD flares and migraine occurring at the same time. As migraine is associated with serotonin release, he encouraged researchers to examine how the serotonin transporters within the GI tract, small bowel, and colon might play a role.
“I think just questioning our patients in terms of quality of life issues — is there any way that we can mitigate their migraine headaches, potentially preventing their inflammatory bowel disease flare, or vice versa, is certainly something to look into,” Dr. Bedford said.

Long COVID fatigue linked to malfunctioning mitochondria
At least 65 million people globally have long COVID.
The most common symptoms of long COVID include post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, brain fog, sleep problems, and fatigue, which can have a severe impact on a person’s life.
Researchers are still unsure why some people develop long COVID and its symptoms while others do not.
Researchers from the Amsterdam University Medical Center have discovered that the fatigue experienced by those with long COVID has a physical cause.
At least 65 million people around the world have long COVID, a condition where they continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms for months after their symptoms originally start.
The most common symptoms of long COVID are fatigue, dizziness, mobility issues, sleep problems, cognitive impairment, and brain fog or inability to concentrate.
These types of lingering symptoms can have a profound impact on a person’s life. A study published in June 2023 found more than half of people with long COVID reported their work, home, social, and private lives were severely impacted by the symptoms, with fatigue being the main problem.
Scientists are still unsure as to why some people develop long COVID and its symptoms while others do not.
Now researchers from the Amsterdam University Medical Center are helping to provide some answers with their new study — recently published in the journal Nature Communications — that found the fatigue experienced by those with long COVID has a physical cause.
Impact of long COVID fatigue on life quality
Prof. Michèle van Vugt, professor of internal medicine at the Amsterdam University Medical Center and co-lead author of this study, told Medical News Today she and her colleagues decided to look for a physical cause of the tiredness experienced by people with long COVID because of the impact it has on their lives.
“Those long COVID patients used to be like you and me totally integrated [into] society with a job, social life, and private life,” Prof. van Vugt explained. “After their COVID infection, for some of them, nothing was left because of their extreme fatigue. And this happened not only in one patient but many more — too many for only [a] psychological cause.”
Past studies report that fatigue is the most common symptom reported by people who have long COVID.
A study published in December 2023 found that people with long COVID self-report persistently continuously low levels of health-related quality of life, as well as a high level of disability and declined levels of physical and mental health.
And research published in April 2023 reported that fatigue caused by long COVID may cause structural changes to the brain.
Lowered mitochondrial function
For this study, Prof. van Vugt and her team recruited 25 people with long COVID and 21 healthy control participants. They were all asked to take a cycling test for approximately 15 minutes, that was designed to push them to maximum exertion.
According to researchers, the cycling test caused a worsening of symptoms in the participants with long COVID, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM), resulting in worsening of fatigue for up to 7 days after.
Scientists examined blood and muscle tissue samples from all participants both one week before the cycling test and one day after.
They found various abnormalities in the muscle tissue of the participants with long COVID, including lowered functioning of the mitochondria of the muscle. Known as the “powerhouse of the cell,” mitochondria are responsible for making the energy needed to power the body’s cells.
“So, the cause of the fatigue is really biological,” Prof. van Vugt explained. “The brain needs energy to think. Muscles need energy to move. This discovery means we can now start to research an appropriate treatment for those with long COVID.”
Tailored exercises: Good or bad for long COVID?
Prof. van Vugt said the the research team was surprised by their study’s findings related to muscle tissue abnormalities.
“However, we [could then] understand much better the symptoms of fatigue in the patients,” she added.
When asked about the next steps planned for this research, Prof. van Vugt said they plan to examine whether the same muscle alterations can be found in other post-infectious patients to hopefully uncover the cause of these changes in the muscle, leading to proof of concept studies for treatment.
“Doctors should acknowledge the complaints of long COVID patients and we should advise very carefully about performing tailored exercises. And as researchers, we should support our medical colleagues with our gained knowledge to support patients with their symptoms and in the meantime [try] to discover a biomarker as a diagnostic tool plus finally a treatment.”
– Prof. Michèle van Vugt
A condition that is challenging to treat
MNT also spoke with Dr. David Cutler, a board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. Dr. Cutler was not involved in the research.
Dr. Cutler commented that the topic of long COVID sparks controversy and strong emotions because it remains poorly defined, difficult to diagnose, and challenging to treat.
“Despite scientific consensus about its existence, the lack of a definitive diagnostic test and its variable presentation continues to make many skeptical of its existence,” he explained. “As a clinician, [I find that] this [research] is helpful in reassuring long COVID sufferers that what they are experiencing is physically real, and not merely psychological.”
“Lacking a specific cure for this condition, the most important treatment physicians can provide is reassurance,” Dr. Cutler continued.
“Patients must be allowed [an] opportunity to present their symptoms to a receptive physician, they must be thoroughly evaluated to exclude other conditions, the diagnosis of long COVID should then be specifically endorsed, patients need to be informed of the generally favorable long-term prognosis, and adequate follow-up provided. This is the basis for optimal reassurance.”
– Dr. David Cutler
Regarding fatigue, Dr. Cutler said a program of graded exercise to avoid worsening symptoms seems to be best.
“However, at this point, the findings of this one study of just 25 patients does not significantly enhance our ability to treat these patients’ complaints of fatigue,” he added. “But it does help to explain their symptoms which aids in reassurance and lessens anxiety. Future research could be aimed at attempts to lessen fatigue with various regimens of exercise, nutritional support, and emotional therapy to ease the suffering of those with long COVID.”

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/could-statins-help-slow-down-the-development-of-dementia-symptoms
Could statins help slow down the development of dementia symptoms?
Statins are a drug that reduces cholesterol in the bloodstream, and while they were initially designed to prevent heart disease and cardiac events, they are increasingly being used to prevent other conditions linked to cholesterol.
Some researchers believe that the most common forms of dementia may be caused in part by changes to cholesterol metabolism and blood flow to the brain.
A longitudinal cohort study of older adults with dementia in Sweden has shown that statin use is linked to improved cognition over a period of three years, with some statins performing better than others.
Every year there are 10 million new dementia cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but few treatment or prevention options available.
The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by a build-up of betamyloid plaques and tau peptide tangles in the brain.
The second most common cause of dementia is vascular dementia, which is caused when blood vessels in the brain get blocked, reducing blood flow to the region.
It can occur after a stroke, but individuals do not have to have a stroke to have vascular dementia. It is also possible that Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia can co-occur.
What is cholesterol’s role in dementia?
High cholesterol is linked to both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, particularly in men. Researchers hypothesize that cholesterol dysregulation prevents the normal breakdown of cholesterol in the body, leading to levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol rising to levels that can cause various problems.
This could lead to atherosclerosis, which can increase the risk of vascular dementia, and it could also dysregulate the take up of the tau protein, which could accelerate its accumulation in the brain, a characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.
That is also why statins could help decrease dementia risk in some cases. Statins are a drug that has been used for decades to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, primarily with the aim of reducing heart disease and resulting cardiac events.
Dr. Clifford Segil, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told Medical News Today:
“In patients with memory loss one of the most common types of dementia is vascular dementia or multi-infarct dementia and any medication which lowers cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors like a statin, would lower patient’s chances of getting this type of dementia.”
Do statins help fight dementia symptoms?
Researchers from Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, have recently looked at the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders (SveDem) to determine if statin use had an impact on cognition in older adults.
The results of their study are reported in a paper published in the journal Alzheimer’s Research and Therapy.
They investigated the records of 15,586 individuals with different forms of dementia, with an average age of 79.5 years at diagnosis, 10,869 of whom took statins. Data were collected from 2007, and all patients were followed until death, emigration or end of follow-up.
Dr. Sara Garcia-Ptacek, assistant professor and neurologist at the Cognitive Clinic, Karolinska University Hospital, lead researcher and lead author of the study, told MNT that “[t]he potential neuroprotective effects of statins have been discussed for a long time.“
“There were some clinical studies which were negative and some observational studies showing an association with dementia prevention and/or progression. SveDem is the world’s largest clinical dementia cohort and the indication and types of patients receiving statins have changed over time,“ she added. “We wanted to check what the association was between statin use and cognition in patients with Alzheimer’s in the SveDem cohort.”
Researchers for the SveDem used a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) to evaluate cognition and this data was recorded. Researchers for this paper analysed the scores recorded at baseline and follow-ups. Data from the cohort was disaggregated into the different types of statin taken by participants. Findings were adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities and medications other than statins.
The researchers found that overall, statin users who took one defined daily dose of statins on average had a 0.63 more MMSE points after 3 years of follow-up compared to those who did not use statins.
Simvastatin, which was the most prescribed statin in Sweden at the time, was associated with 1.01 more MMSE points after 3 years compared to atorvastatin users. Patients under 79.5 years when diagnosed who took simvastatin had 0.80 more MMSE points compared to younger atorvastatin users after 3 years. Simvastatin users had 1.03 more MMSE points compared to rosuvastatin users after 3 years.
Statins are safe to take in dementia
The study confirmed that, despite previous concerns that statins could cause confusion, that they are in fact safe in this group of older patients with dementia, and do not contribute to cognitive decline, said Dr. Segil.
Dr Garcia-Ptacek said: “Our current hypothesis is that these two things may be simultaneously true: acute changes when starting statins — for example, in brain cholesterol — could potentially cause confusion in sensitive individuals while the long-term effects could be protective. However, this is just an hypothesis which will need to be confirmed in future studies”
Further research needed to be done to determine the mechanism that could underlie these findings, she explained, adding:
“We need to examine how statins affect cholesterol, brain cholesterol and brain connectivity, and how the effects change with short or long-term treatment. We need to understand which patients potentially benefit from statins, if at all, in order to design a targeted clinical trial. We need to know how different genotypes (e.g. ApoE) modify this response. ApoE is a cholesterol transporter and the genetic [risk of Alzheimer’s the] allele ApoE4 confers [is higher].”
Dr. Segil, who was not involved in this research, said he wanted to see more data comparing the different types of statin: “This study investigated three different generic cholesterol-lowering medications, or ‘statins,’ which include rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin. I am intrigued to see long term follow-up in the patients who received these three medications to see if data supports neurologists like me using one of these over another [drug], due to data indicating one statin helps prevent memory loss more than another.“
“As a family of medications, statins often are not [well] tolerated, and rosuvastatin in clinical practice is better tolerated than atorvastatin, and I would be interested in seeing if rosuvastatin helped patients with memory loss in a follow-up study head to head with atorvastatin,” he pointed out.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stroke-increase-dementia-risk-3-times-higher-in-first-year
Stroke could increase dementia risk by 80%, new research finds
Each year, about 15 million people around the world have a stroke.
Past studies show having a stroke can increase a person’s risk for certain diseases, such as dementia.
Researchers from McMaster University report having a stroke increases a person’s dementia risk by 80%, even after accounting for other dementia risk factors.
Scientists also found dementia risk was three times higher in the first year after a stroke.
Each year, about 15 million people around the world have a stroke — a condition where a blood vessel leading to the brain is blocked or bursts, causing a lack of oxygen to the brain.
Of that number, researchers estimate about half will live with a permanent or chronic disability, such as paralysis on one side of the body, communication difficulties, memory loss, or problems with gripping or holding items.
Past studies also show that having a stroke can increase a person’s risk for diseases such as vision issues, depression, post-stroke fatigue, trouble swallowing, cancer, and dementia.
Now, new research presented at the American Stroke Association’s International Stroke Conference 2024 reports that having a stroke increased a person’s dementia risk by 80%, even after accounting for other dementia risk factors. The findings have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Researchers also found dementia risk was three times higher in the first year after a stroke.
This risk decreased to a 1.5-times increased risk by five years after a stroke and remained elevated 20 years later.
What is the link between stroke and dementia?
During a stroke, the oxygen flow is cut off to the brain. This can result in the death of brain cells, causing dementia. Vascular dementia is a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.
However, past studies show having a stroke can also increase a person’s risk for another type of dementia, known as Alzheimer’s disease, as well as all-cause dementia.
Dr. Raed Joundi is an assistant professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, an investigator at the Population Health Research Institute, a joint institute of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, an adjunct scientist at ICES, and the lead author of this study.
Dr. Joundi told Medical News Today that the researchers decided to further investigate the link between stroke and increased dementia risk because, with an aging population, more people are experiencing stroke, and an increasing number of people are surviving the consequences of stroke.
“Cognitive impairment is very common after stroke and may lead to dementia, which lowers quality of life and decreases life expectancy. It is important to show a direct link between stroke and dementia, and investigate the timing of dementia after stroke, to inform the research, planning, and delivery of interventions.”
– Dr. Joundi
Increased dementia risk among people who had a stroke
For this study, Dr. Joundi and his team analyzed data from more than 15 million people in Ontario, Canada through medical databases. About 181,000 people were identified as having either an ischemic stroke (stroke caused by a clot in arteries around the brain) or intracerebral hemorrhage (burst blood vessel in the brain) who survived without dementia for at least 90 days.
The stroke participants were matched to two different control groups — one of people in the general population who had not had a stroke or heart attack, and another group of people who had had a heart attack but not a stroke.
Upon analysis, scientists found dementia risk was 80% higher in people who had a stroke when compared to the control group with no heart attack or stroke. The risk for dementia was almost 80% higher in people who had a stroke when compared to the control group who had a heart attack and no stroke.
“We were able to show that the elevated risk of dementia persisted even after matching to control (comparison) groups with the same age, sex, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and vascular risk factors.
As stroke imposes a direct injury on the brain, which may have an immediate impact but also long-term impacts on brain function, this result is not entirely surprising but important to confirm through this large and robust analysis.”
– Dr. Joundi
Dementia risk 3 times higher in first year after stroke
Additionally, the researchers discovered dementia risk was almost three times higher in the first year following a stroke. The risk declined to a 1.5-times increased risk by the five-year mark following a stroke and remained elevated 20 years later.
“We found a three-fold risk of dementia between three and 12 months after stroke,” Dr. Joundi explained. “The first three months after stroke were not included as it is usually too early to make a definitive diagnosis of dementia.”
“The presence of a higher risk of dementia earlier after stroke is not too surprising, since there is a direct brain injury from the stroke which can impact cognition and daily function, and physicians are following up closer with patients in the first year and therefore more likely to make a diagnosis of dementia,” he continued. “The more surprising aspect was that the increased risk of dementia persisted throughout 20 years of follow-up, compared to matched controls, so there are many indirect mechanisms that may be acting long-term to promote a higher risk of dementia after stroke.”
Stroke prevention key to reducing dementia risk
After reviewing this study, Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, told MNT that this study demonstrates the elevated risk for stroke victims to develop dementia, a risk that is markedly high, even higher than the risk of developing another stroke.
“This study highlights the importance of discussing with stroke patients and their family members the increased risk of developing dementia. These patients will need to be monitored carefully for evidence of cognitive decline, and medication and lifestyle modifications should be initiated to reduce their risk.”
– Dr. Chen
MNT also discussed the study with Dr. José Morales, a vascular neurologist and neuro-interventional surgeon at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA.
Dr. Morales said he was surprised by how much higher a dementia risk was found in the study compared to prior studies.
“It really provides added emphasis on the idea of doing everything we can to prevent stroke, by either primary prevention through lifestyle changes or secondary prevention with medical management to optimize their vascular risk factors,” he added.

How to prevent RSV in infants and young children, according to experts
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus that may cause severe symptoms in infants, young children, and even older adults.
RSV is the most common cause of infant hospitalizations in high-income countries.
In 2019, about 1.4 million infants ages 0–6 months globally were hospitalized for episodes of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection.
RSV infection can become serious, but there are ways to protect infants and young children from severe illness.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) commonly presents with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and cough.
However, in infants and young children, RSV can be much more severe, leading to hospitalizations and even death. RSV may also cause severe illness among older adults.
RSV is the most common cause of infant hospitalizations in high-income countries.
In 2019, about 6.6 million infants ages 0-6 months globally had RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes, with 1.4 million needing to be hospitalized and 45,700 RSV-attributable overall deaths.
What can be done to protect infants and small children from severe illness due to RSV? Medical News Today spoke with pediatricians to learn more.
How does RSV affect a baby?
According to Dr. Danelle Fisher, a board certified pediatrician and Chair of Pediatrics at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, while RSV will cause symptoms of the common cold in older children and adults, it may affect infants and young children differently.
“The younger you are, the more chance you have of this virus causing severe respiratory issues, including wheezing and difficulty breathing,” Dr. Fisher told MNT.
“A lot of times, even the little babies will go apneic, which means they pause or stop breathing for a little while. The younger you are, the more dangerous it can be.”
Dr. Mohamed Zebda, a board certified pediatrician at the UH Health Family Care Center and clinical associate professor at the Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine at the University of Houston, explained to MNT:
“Most children have had RSV at least once by the age of 2. Many children will have mild symptoms. Common symptoms include cough, congestion, runny nose, and fever.”
“Infants who are born prematurely, babies who have a history of congenital heart disease, children who are immunocompromised, children who have a history of chronic lung disease, and infants less than 1 year of age have an elevated risk of complications and hospitalization.
Complications of RSV include bronchiolitis — inflammation and irritation of the small airways that lead to narrowing of the airways — and pneumonia.”
— Dr. Mohamed Zebda, board certified pediatrician
How do babies get RSV?
RSV spreads both through respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, as well as contaminated surfaces.
“RSV can spread from person to person, just like colds and other respiratory viruses,” Dr. Kris Bryant, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Norton Children’s in Louisville, Kentucky, and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases explained to MNT.
“The virus can also live on hard surfaces for many hours, and touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth is one way infections can occur,” Dr. Bryant continued.
“RSV can also live on hands for 30 minutes or more, so handwashing is important in reducing the spread of this virus.”
“RSV is spread when a baby inhales droplets from an infected person’s cough or sneeze,” added Dr. Moses Olorunnisola, a pediatrician with Hackensack Meridian Children’s Health Medical Group in New Jersey.
“A baby can also contract RSV from direct contact — if an infected person kisses them on the face, for example. Additionally, If a baby touches a toy or surface that is contaminated, and then touches his or her eyes, mouth, or nose, they can contract RSV,” Dr. Olorunnisola continued.
“The problem with this virus is that it spreads very quickly throughout places where children are,” Dr. Fisher said. “If you have multiple children in the family, oftentimes the older kids who go to preschool, daycare, or elementary school will bring it home to their baby siblings and that is a big mode of transmission.”
— Dr. Danelle Fisher, board certified pediatrician
How is RSV treated in babies?
If an infant contracts RSV, Dr. Olorunnisola told MNT the treatment may depend on the symptoms.
“Babies may need IV fluids if they are unable to drink adequately and become dehydrated,” he detailed.
“Saline and nasal suction may also be used if the baby has significant nasal congestion and mucus production. Some babies may need medication to help manage fevers. Some babies also require oxygen and breathing support if they have severe respiratory problems. Overall, the goal is to manage whatever symptoms are present,” Dr. Olorunnisola explained.
“Antibiotics are not helpful for RSV since RSV is a viral infection and not a bacterial infection,” Dr. Zebda said.
“RSV symptoms tend to peak (on) day 3-5 of (the) illness and gradually get better. It is important for parents to seek immediate help for any increased work of breathing,” he added.
How can you reduce a baby’s risk of RSV?
Dr. Zebda said there are several ways to help minimize a baby’s exposure to RSV.
“Good hand hygiene can help reduce the spread of RSV,” he explained. “(Make) sure that surfaces, including toys, are disinfected. It is recommended to cover coughs and sneezes. (Make) sure visitors coming to see the baby are not sick. Outside visitors should avoid holding and kissing the baby,” Dr. Zebda noted.
“To the extent feasible, parents should keep their babies away from people with cold and flu symptoms and avoid crowds during RSV season,” Dr. Bryant added.
“For my families who have children in day care and preschool, during RSV season, which is usually October through April, I often advise that when these children come home from day care or preschool, the families kind of wash them down,” Dr. Fisher said.
“They could even do their bath or at the very least washing hands and face and changing clothes can minimize the spread,” Dr. Fisher continued.
Should you get an RSV vaccine during pregnancy?
In addition to limiting an infant’s exposure after they are born, the maternal RSV vaccine can protect a newborn from severe illness. baby can be protected from RSV.
The maternal RSV vaccine is administered during pregnancy and is currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
“If you are pregnant, you should definitely consider getting the RSV vaccine to help protect your baby from RSV,” Dr. Olorunnisola said.
“Pregnant individuals at 32 to 36 weeks gestational age during the months of September through January should get the RSV vaccine as their antibodies are passed on to their baby. This will significantly reduce the likelihood that the baby, once born, will get severe disease or be hospitalized from RSV.”
— Dr. Moses Olorunnisola, a pediatrician
“The RSV vaccine helps produce maternal antibodies against RSV, and those maternal antibodies are then passed to the baby and help protect the baby,” Dr. Zebda explained.
“According to the CDC, the RSV vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV by 57%. If you are currently pregnant, it is important to discuss the RSV vaccine with your OB-GYN or current healthcare provider,” Dr. Zebda added.
Other ways to protect infants from RSV
Dr. Bryant said that pregnant people unable to receive the maternal RSV vaccine can immunize the baby after birth.
“Nirsevimab is not a vaccine but rather a monoclonal antibody shot that protects infants against RSV infections that are severe enough to require a healthcare visit or hospitalization,” she explained.
“Most babies born to people who received the RSV vaccine during pregnancy do not need nirsevimab too,” Dr. Bryant noted.
Dr. Fisher added the monoclonal antibody shot is given to infants 8 months or younger during RSV season.
“It floods the baby’s system with antibodies directly against RSV,” Dr. Fisher continued.
So it’s not a vaccine per se — the baby’s immune system doesn’t have to kick up. But it’s really great passive protection that we love to give these babies. It does not prevent RSV from happening, but it does prevent the most serious complications, including ER visits and hospitalizations — that’s what we’re all about,” she concluded.

Black women with high blood pressure before age 35 have triple the risk of a stroke
New research shows that Black women who develop high blood pressure before the age of 35 may have triple the odds of having a stroke
Black people are more likely to have high blood pressure, owing to a multitude of factors
Experts say it’s important for both doctors and patients to be aware of this elevated risks and screen accordingly – even for younger women
The risk can be managed through lifestyle changes and consultation with a doctor
A new American Heart Association (AHA) preliminary study shows that younger Black women with high blood pressure could have an increased risk of stroke.
The data, which will be presented next week at the AHA’s International Stroke Conference in Phoenix, analyzed 59,000 Black women in the United States between the ages of 24 and 64 who had not had a stroke.
After following up with participants, researchers reported that the women who developed high blood pressure before the age of 35 were more than three times as likely to have a stroke.
The research hasn’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal.
Nonetheless, the study’s lead author told Medical News Today that the findings underline the importance of primary prevention and screening for high blood pressure.
Strokes can occur in younger people
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is more prevalent in Black adults in the United States, so researchers said it wasn’t surprising to find a high incidence in study participants.
Dr. Hugo Aparicio, the lead study author and an associate professor of neurology at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, told Medical News Today that 10% of study participants younger than 45 and nearly 40% aged 45 to 64 had high blood pressure.
“However, the most concerning finding was that risk of stroke from an early age, such as the second or third decades, appeared to impart the highest risk of a stroke over the period of follow-up,” he explained.
Experts note that since high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, it stands to reason that younger people with hypertension could have a stroke at a relatively young age.
“There is often the misconception that this heightened risk of stroke isn’t really apparent until older age and therefore healthcare providers are often less concerned when high blood pressure is identified in younger people,” said Michelle O’Donoghue, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and McGillycuddy-Logue Distinguished Chair in Cardiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the research.
“Although the risk of mid-life stroke is relatively low, this study importantly highlights that early onset of hypertension is a very important predictor of this event, and stroke can occur in middle age,” O’Donoghue told Medical News Today.
Why Black women are affected
Aparicio said he and his colleagues attempted to account for various factors, including a participant’s region of the country and socioeconomic status, along with risk factors such as excess body weight, smoking, and diabetes.
Even after accounting for this, the researchers said they still continued to see the elevated risk of stroke with a history of hypertension across age groups.
“Factors such as psychosocial stressors, or experience with racial discrimination, have been correlated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke,” Aparicio said. “Hypertensive disorders or onset associated with pregnancy have also been related to stroke, specifically among Black women, who have higher rates of these pregnancy complications.”
O’Donoghue points out that Black men and women are undertreated for high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease for reasons that are likely multi-faceted.
“It can be challenging in many regions to find a primary care doctor for routine health maintenance,” she said. “Challenges with access to medications, challenges with adherence and attending doctors visits are just some of barriers that we don’t spend enough time thinking about in our conversations with patients.”
A genetic factor that also uniquely affects Black people is lipoprotein (a), a type of cholesterol that’s associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke.
“We know that average [lipoprotein (a)] levels may be more than threefold higher in Black persons, yet this under-recognized risk factor is rarely being assessed in clinical practice,” O’Donoghue explained.
Prevention and screening
While there’s a genetic factor to high blood pressure, other aspects can be controlled to lower one’s risk of developing hypertension, along with heart disease and stroke.
This strategy can start with a doctor’s visit, where blood pressure tests and screening can help people get a handle on their overall health.
“Make sure that even mildly elevated blood pressures are tracked and addressed through prevention efforts like changes in diet or exercise, quitting smoking, and developing better sleep habits,” advised Aparicio. “To reduce risk of stroke, also pay attention to managing specific risk factors like excess body weight, abnormal blood cholesterol levels, and elevated blood pressure.”
Aparicio notes that these findings, along with other data related to Black people and hypertension, underlines the importance for both doctors and patients to pay special attention to screening.
“Neither hypertension nor risk of stroke should be perceived as [just] problems of older women,” he said. “We also need healthcare policy changes that emphasize, promote, and fund primary prevention because for Black women having a stroke at middle age, it is often too late.”

Scientists reprogram T cells to slow down and reverse aging
Scientists are constantly looking for ways to help slow the aging process.
Researchers from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory have discovered that T cells in the body can be reprogrammed to slow down and even reverse aging.
Using a mouse model, scientists found T cells can be used to fight off another type of cell that contributes to aging.
Even before Ponce de León supposedly found the Fountain of Youth, humans have always been looking for a way to slow the aging process.
As the number of centenarians — those who reach their 100th birthday — continues to rise, research and medical innovations are helping people to live longer, healthier lives. However, there are still plenty of new measures and methods for scientists to explore.
New research from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, that says the body’s T cells — a type of white blood cell — can be reprogrammed to fight aging.
Using a mouse model, scientists found that T cells can be used to fend off another type of cell that increases as a person ages and causes inflammation, rendering the aging immune system less effective over time.
The study was recently published in the journal Nature Aging.
Using CAR T-cell therapy to reverse aging
T cells are a type of white blood cell known as lymphocytes. They are an important part of the immune system, helping the body to find and destroy potentially harmful pathogens such as viruses and bacteria.
T cells are unique in that different T cells are designed to seek and destroy specific pathogens.
For example, a baby’s T cells will be tasked with remembering different viruses they come in contact with for the first time. Then as the baby grows and becomes older, those same T cells can be used to fight off those same viruses throughout their life.
T cells are made within the body’s bone marrow. They then move to the thymus gland to further develop. Once mature, T cells travel to the tissues and organs within the lymphatic system and circulate within the bloodstream.
Over the past few years, researchers have been looking at ways to use T cells to fight certain diseases such as cancer.
This has led to the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy — a type of immunotherapy where T cells are taken from a person, altered in the lab, and then infused back into the same person to fight a particular type of cancer.
Scientists have also been researching the use of CAR T-cell therapy in the treatment of non-cancer diseases such as autoimmune diseases and viral infections like HIV and hepatitis C.
How do T cells change with age?
Dr. Corina Amor Vegas, assistant professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and lead author of this study, said they focused on T cells as a potential way to fight aging because the immune system is really powerful at eliminating damaged cells in younger individuals.
“Thus, we wondered whether in aging we could redirect and repower the T cells to eliminate the damaged cells that accumulate,” Dr. Amor Vegas told Medical News Today.
Dr. Amor Vegas referred to these damaged cells as “senescent cells.”
“Senescent cells are cells in our body that have accumulated a lot of damage and as a result they have stopped doing their normal jobs and instead become very inflammatory. The accumulation of these cells in tissues is really deleterious because it creates a severe proinflammatory microenvironment that prevents the other cells in the tissue from working properly too.”

Previous studies have examined the use of senescent cells as a therapeutic target for aging and age-related diseases.
Eliminating damaged cells led to healthier aging
For this study, Dr. Amor Vegas and her team found they could use CAR T-cell therapy to eliminate damaged or senescent cells in mice.
Scientists found the mice treated with CAR T-cell therapy to remove senescent cells became healthier with lower body weight, improved metabolism and glucose tolerance, and increased physical activity.
“We were very excited to see that the CAR T cells were able to eliminate the senescent cells and drive these effects,” Dr. Amor Vegas said. “We were also really excited about the long-term durability of these effects.”
“Interestingly, in our work, we saw not only therapeutic effects when we treated aged animals but we also saw preventive effects,” she continued. “Thus, when we treated young animals — once, only in their youth — and we let them age, they aged better.”
When asked about future plans for this research, D. Amor Vegas said they are interested in the potential implications for the treatment of age-related diseases in humans.
“Nonetheless it’s a long road and there is still a lot more research that needs to be done to optimize the approach,” she added.
Implications for healthy aging in humans
MNT also spoke with Dr. Yi Zhang, director member of the Center for Discovery and Innovation (CDI), professor at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, and co-leader of the Cancer-Host-Interaction Program at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington, DC, about this study.
Dr. Zhang said that healthy aging will need wise, optimistic, and effective strategies to deal with population aging.
Currently, Dr. Zhang added, how tissues undergo senescence and how senescent cells trigger harmful inflammation remain poorly defined.
“(Dr. Amor Vegas’) study discovers an innovative strategy that can be leveraged to not only address these questions but also to facilitate the elimination of senescent cells,” Dr. Zhang explained.
“In addition, given the fact that CAR T-cell treatment has transformed (the) treatment of cancer in human patients, this study also provides a proof-of-concept that programming T cells with CARs specific to markers associated with senescent cells will find new applications to improving the health of aging humans.”
“Many efforts have been made to develop small molecule drugs to clear senescent cells, namely senolytic therapies. However, these studies are limited by poorly defined molecular pathways that mediate senescence and its associated chronic inflammatory damage to normal tissues during aging.
Future research is needed to address this issue. In addition, it is important to investigate how the study using a mouse system can be translated into a senolytic therapy in humans.”
